Payment made in deniers, a special item. You can also buy wood there, and the \"village wand\".\n- Bakery (when built, requires only wood, so normally they can do it without help): buy bread.\n- Tavern (when built, requires glass, so only after you've sold enough to the villagers): buy cider and in upgrade taverns calva. Cider and calva can be used mltiple times and give back health.\n\nTo trade, go to one of the locations in question and stand near the chests. If no woman is around one will arrive shortly. Right-click on her to bring up the trade screen.\n\nHold the left shift key while clicking on a trade good in the trade screen to trade 8 by 8 or the left control key to trade 64 by 64."
