The end poem can remain silent through the entire 10 minutes.\nOn rare occasions the track may play, but plays at the incorrect time and cuts out when the credits finished. I once had it just start to play at the \"Twenty years from now...\" quote, which is the very end of the poem.\n\n\n\n最强bgm已经可以正常播放了\n\n\n\n",
