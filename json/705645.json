The MultiInv author does plan to add attribute support so hopefully a newer version of MultiInv will resolve this in the future. For now the workaround is to store any STB items before you switch inventories.LWC: LWC is supported, but you must use a recent dev build of LWC with UUID support. Dev builds of LWC can be obtained from http://ci.griefcraft.com/job/LWC/. If you can't use a recent build, then you can disable LWC support: see Protection.WorldEdit, Movecraft or indeed any plugin which move regions of blocks around or directly clear regions without firing events: don't use them with any region which contains an STB block. The physical block will be moved or removed, but STB doesn't (can't) know that and will keep a record for the associated STB object in memory.

Now with SlimefunOres, you can get dusts by breaking ores!CS-CoreLib and Slimefun must be installed for this plugin to work!By breaking ores you can get:Iron DustGold DustAluminum DustZinc DustTin DustCopper DustMagnesium DustLead DustSilver DustTiny Piles of Uranium (Only available from diamond and emerald ore)\nMilestonesThank you for the 1000 Downloads!Thank you for the 5000 Downloads!\nOld & New AlgorithmFrom version 1.4, I added a new choosing algorithm because the liast one wasn't completely random. Basically, the old algorithm had an order going on like this (most common on left): Iron Dust > Gold Dust > Aluminum Dust > Copper Dust > Zinc Dust > Tin Dust > Magnesium Dust > Lead Dust > Silver Dust. This means that the iron dust and gold dust would be the most common to get, lead and silver the rarest. The new algorithm is completely random, which means that each dust has an equal chance of getting chosen.You can only get dusts if the ore you break hasn't been placed down and has been naturally generated.Example Configoptions:  auto-update: true //Enable this if you want the plugin to get auto updated.  old-algorithm: false //Enable this if you want to use the old dust choosing algorithm.coal_ore:  overall_chance: 25 //This is the chance in percentage.

The shard has 5 tiers each one makes it react differently when spawning entities. Stats of the souls are below.
