No, it’s well worth reading!\n背包盘点：护腿\n本文浪费时间？不，本文值得一读！\n\nI don’t know for sure, but I reckon Minecraft’s leg-sleeves are referred to as “leggings” to avoid the whole trousers/pants problem between British and American English. For Americans, the two are synonymous. But in Britain, pants refers to underwear. Which makes shopping for clothes across the Atlantic a fraught experience.\n虽然不是非常确定，但我觉得之所以 Minecraft 里面把这个腿上穿的东西叫做 \"leggings\" ，是为了避免 trousers/pants 这样的英美用词差异。在美式英语中，两个词意思一样。但是在英式英语中， pants 指的是短裤。这让人们在大洋对岸买衣服的时候总会闹出点误会。\n\n“Leggings” are easy to make in Minecraft. Grab seven bits of leather, iron, gold or diamond and arrange them around the upper edges of the crafting grid. You can also find them in chests, and sometimes a zombie, zombie pigman or skeleton will drop them when they die. Sometimes they’ll drop chainmail armour, which can’t be crafted, but can be repaired with iron ingots.\n在 Minecraft 里面制作护腿非常简单。拿上 7 份皮革，铁锭，金锭或者钻石，然后在合成格中沿着上边缘放置即可。在箱子里也能找到护腿，有时候僵尸、僵尸猪人和骷髅也会在死亡时掉落护腿。有时候怪物掉落的是链甲，这种盔甲没法合成，但是可以用铁锭来修补。\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ningame.jpg (56.9 KB, 下载次数: 11)\n\n下载附件\n\n2019-2-17 18:05 上传\n\n\n\n\n\nArmour was intended to be part of the game from the very beginning. Originally, the plan was that there would be two types – iron and steel. But when it was implemented in February 2010, it came in the five varieties that remain today – leather, gold, iron, chainmail, and diamond. At first, the differences were merely cosmetic, but in version 1.0.0 a tier system was implemented, where each level of armour offers different levels of protection and durability.\n盔甲在游戏最早期的时候就已经成为计划中的一部分了。开始的时候，计划中的盔甲只有两类——铁甲和金甲。而到了 2010 年 2 月，才补全到了五个种类，而且一直持续到了现在——皮甲，金甲，铁甲，链甲，以及钻石甲。最初，不同盔甲只有外表上的区别，等到 1.0.0 版本的时候，才补充了等级系统，也就意味着不同档次的盔甲会有不同等级的保护与耐久了。\n\nEvery type of legging has a number of armour points, which are signified by half-shields above the health bar. Each half-shield reduces damage by four percent, so a full bar of 20 points reduces damage by 80 percent. There’s another factor called toughness, which only applies to diamond armour, but maybe that’s a story for next week’s Taking Inventory...\n所有种类的护腿都有其盔甲点数，显示位置在血条之上，半格代表一点盔甲点数。每点盔甲点数可以减少 4% 的伤害，所以全满的盔甲条，也就是 20 点盔甲点数，可以减少 80% 的伤害。还有另一个影响因素叫盔甲韧性，只在钻石甲上有应用，但是这可能需要留到下一周的《背包盘点》再说了……\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nrealworld.jpg (97.64 KB, 下载次数: 10)\n\n下载附件\n\n2019-2-17 18:05 上传\n\n\n\n\n\nImage credit: Geoff Derrin\n图片来源：Geoff Derrin\n\nIn the real world, the oldest known trousers were removed from a pair of mummies found in northwestern China, and are believed to date back to the period between the 13th and the 10th century BC. They were made of wool, had straight legs, and were likely designed for horseback riding. \n在现实中，最古老的裤子是在中国西南部出土的一对古尸身上取出的，据信能追溯到公元前 13 世纪到 10 世纪之间。它是用羊毛制成的，有笔直的裤腿，很可能是为马背上的骑乘而设计的。\n\nIn their earliest days, trousers were worn by both sexes, but for most of modern history in the Western world the use of trousers has been restricted to men – sometimes by law. In the 1850s, many US cities passed anti-crossdressing laws, criminalizing appearing in public in \"a dress not belonging to his or her sex\". These laws persisted well into the 20th century – Cincinnati, Ohio, passed one in 1974.\n在裤子出现的早期，所有性别的人都穿裤子，但在绝大部分的现代西方历史中，裤子被严格限制于男士穿着——有时候还是用法律作出的限制。在 19 世纪50年代，许多美国的城市都通过了禁止变装的法律，将在公众场合中“穿着不属于本人性别的衣装”视为犯罪。这些法律一直留存到了 20 世纪——俄亥俄州的辛辛那提市在 1974 年都还通过了这样的法律。\n\nToday, many of these sexist laws have been revoked, but perhaps more recently than you might imagine. Women were not allowed to wear trousers on the U.S. Senate floor until 1993. And many other parts of the world still enforce strict rules around what women are allowed to wear.\n现在，很多这种性方面的法律已经被撤除了，但是时间可能比你想的还要晚得多。直到 1993 年之前，女性都不准在美国参议院穿着裤子。在世界上的其他地方依然还有很多严格的规定在限制女性的穿着。\n\nIn Minecraft, we think you should be able to wear trousers/leggings whenever you like, whatever gender you are. Which do you prefer to wear? Ones made of leather, gold, iron, chainmail or diamond? We thought once about adding trousers made of cobwebs. But then we realised that they wouldn’t work – the flies would get stuck. Fan mail to the usual address, please!\n在 Minecraft 里，我们认为，不论你是什么性别，你都可以随时随地穿着裤子/护腿。你喜欢穿什么呢？皮甲，金甲，铁甲，链甲，还是钻石甲？我们之前设想过加入蜘蛛网做的裤子。不过随后我们就意识到这行不通——裤链会被粘住的。请粉丝们继续给老地址发邮件，谢谢！\n\n【Kakagou译自Taking Inventory: Leggings】\n【作者Duncan Geere，发布时间2019年2月15日】",
