    "txt_content": " 本帖最后由 xjboss 于 2015-6-8 20:07 编辑 \n\n为IC2版MFFS更名而来\n是IC2论坛一群不满UE的MFFS，从原作者Thunderdark得到源码继续开发的。\n现已更名为ARS\n\n本MOD可以建立力场来阻挡生物或者玩家的侵入\n\n本MOD采用LGPL协议，源码已经加在下载文件里了。\n\n注意：原版的语言文件并不包括GUI，我汉化的版本已经修改了源码并把GUI部分添加到语言文件中。\n\n\n\n\n2014-11-16_22.25.27.jpg (93.83 KB, 下载次数: 140)\n\n下载附件\n\n2014-11-16 22:54 上传\n\n\n\n\n\n\n建立力场\n\n\n\n\n2014-11-16_23.31.47.png (235.27 KB, 下载次数: 154)\n\n下载附件\n\n2014-11-16 23:37 上传\n\n\n\n\n\n\n已经完美汉化 包括GUI\n\n需要IC2EXP和immibis-core\n\nIC2EXP站内搬运：http://www.mcbbs.net/forum.php?m ... =%E5%B7%A5%E4%B8%9A\nimmibis-core在网盘内已经有了\n\n原帖教程\n\n核心\n开始发展力场的时候，需要一个力场核心。:\n\n(electrolyzer, MFE, 2 electrolyzed water cells, 2 advanced circuits, 2 advanced alloy, energy modulator)\n能量调节器像这样合成:\n\n\n连接核心到电源. 注意 1 EU = 10 (力场能量)forcepower.\n\n现在你需要一个投影机. There are several types of projectors, and each of them create a differently shaped forcefield.\nThere is a cooldown time after activating or deactivating a projector in which it may not be activated or deactivated again, to prevent spam.\n\n投影机\n\nAll of the types of projectors require a projector base, crafted like this:\n\nYou \"program\" it with a pattern by crafting it with reinforced stone.\nThe circular diamond thing is a diamond lens:\n\n\n\nThis is an area projector, which creates either a cube or a sphere centred on the projector.\n\n\nThis is a tube projector. It creates a tube-shaped forcefield, extending in one or both directions from the projector. You can use a wrench to change the direction the projector faces.\n\n\nThis is a plate projector (previously called a deflector). It creates a flat forcefield some distance in front of the projector. Use a wrench to change the direction the projector faces.\n\n\nThis is a line projector (previously called a directional projector).\nBy default it can only create a forcefield in a line in front of it, but you can place line projector extenders next to it to make it project a flat forcefield in that direction.\nThis is the recipe for an extender:\n\n\nThere's also the \"reactor containment field projector\" - see the Nuclear Reactors section.\n\n连接\nOkay, so you've got a forcefield core and a projector of some sort. Now what?\nFirst, you need to craft a blank card:\n新版合成:\n\n旧版合成:\n\nThen place the card in the forcefield core to code it with that core's frequency. You can remove it immediately.\nAlternatively, simply right click the core with a blank card to encode it.\nPlace the coded card in the projector to link the projector to the core (either via the GUI or by right clicking).\nYou can then apply a redstone signal to the projector to activate it, if the core has enough power.\n\n升级\n\nAll upgrades can be placed diagonally adjacent to projectors - they don't need to have a face touching the projector.\n\n\nThis is a camouflage upgrade. By placing one next to a projector, you can make the forcefield from that projector look like another block.\nNote: Only certain vanilla blocks are currently supported.\n\n\nThis is a block cutter upgrade. By placing one next to a projector, that projector will be able to break blocks if they're in the way of the forcefield.\nWorks on all projectors.\n\n\nThis is a dome upgrade. Makes an area or tube projector only create the upper half of its forcefield (a half-sphere, half-cube or half-tube).\nOnly works on area and tube projectors.\n\n\nThis is a range upgrade. Allows projectors to be placed further from their linked core. Only works on forcefield cores.\n\n\nThis is a storage upgrade. Allows forcefield cores to store more energy. Only works on forcefield cores.\n\n\nThis is an underwater upgrade. If used on a tube or area projector, water and lava blocks inside the projector will be destroyed when the projector is turned on.\nOnly works on tube and area projectors.\n\n\nThis is a zapper upgrade. Makes the forcefield turn red and hurt entities that touch it. It also breaks boats.\n\n\nThis is an inhibitor upgrade. It prevents fields from different cores which are activated after the one with the inhibitor from appearing inside the field it's attached to. Only works on area projectors.\n\n核反应堆\n\n\nThis is a reactor containment field projector. Place it one block away from a reactor (so there is a one-block gap between the projector and the reactor; it is acceptable to have it touching a chamber), or directly next to a zero-chamber reactor.\nWhen it gets a redstone signal, it will create a 3x3x3 or 5x5x5 forcefield around the reactor.\nIf you manage to get yourself stuck in the forcefield, you can get out by breaking this block.\nIn the GUI is an option called \"reactorwatercool.\" If set to true, there will be water inside the forcefield when it is active, for an extra energy cost.\nIf the reactor exceeds 75% of its maximum heat, the projector should automatically activate and will destroy blocks in the way of the forcefield, as if you had a block cutter upgrade, to contain any explosion. This is known to work in 1.2.5, but untested with the reactor overhaul in 1.3.2.\n\n\nThis is a reactor connector.\nPlace it in the wall of a reactor field, touching the reactor or a chamber, to conduct redstone signals and electricity through the forcefield.\nIt is explosionproof.\n\nMF设备\n\n这是一个 MF设备. Right click any side of a force field projector to move the field in the direction of that side (For example, click the top to move it down). Shift-click to move in the opposite direction. You cannot move forcefields while they are on.\n\n栅栏\nThese are from the old mod DeFence.\nChain link fence:\n\nChain link fences are indestructible normally, but can be broken instantly with cutters.\nBarbed wire fence: (shapeless)\n\nBarbed wire fences act like webs and cacti - slowing the player down and hurting them.\n\nCode doors are also from DeFence. Either of the following recipes will make one:\n\n\nUse the GUI to set a 1 to 4 digit access code.\nAnyone who knows the access code can open the door.\nIf you didn't place the door, you can't break it, unless it's open or you're in creative.\n\n下载地址\n\n\n汉化版/原版 下载(百度网盘)\n原作者下载地址(跨过那该死的墙吧)\n\n\n旧版本下载\n\n\nrev6 to rev10 (client only)\nrev10.2 including server\nLinks to 50.0.2+ (including server)\n\n\n\n\n",
