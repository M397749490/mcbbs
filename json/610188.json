Planet Minecraft was officially created in 2010.\n\nWhat We Aren'tPlanet Minecraft is not affiliated with Mojang in any official capacity. We do not sell Minecraft accounts or give them away for free. We do not deal with disputes between users and server owners. We are only here to share our Minecraft experiences with other Minecraft fans.\n\n\nAccountsThis section gives you information on what you are and are not allowed to do with your Planet Minecraft account, as well as various states your account may be in. The moderators and staff on Planet Minecraft have the right to lock or ban your account if necessary according to the rules listed below. These rules are in place to keep the community clean and safe.\nCreationYou are allowed to make 1 Planet Minecraft account per individual. Having a Planet Minecraft account will grant you access to additional features within the site including commenting on submissions, giving diamonds on submissions, making a list of favorites submissions, subscribing to your favorite creators, and joining some of our advanced features like chat, the forums, and the official server.\nThere are very strict limitations for when you would be allowed to have a second account beyond your primary account. Exceptions should be requested via the Ticket system. You will need a solid reason as to why the new account will be used to fulfill a requirement that our site does not currently offer. On any accounts that are being used as alternates that have been allowed via exceptions/tickets, you must provide a link to the original account (or users using the account) on your About Me, so that the public is not lead into believing they are separate accounts and are aware as to who is running them. Creating additional accounts without explicitly being cleared will result in increased ban length, removal of new account(s), removal of submissions, etc. Please don't forget that you have the ability to change your name in your account settings! This is preferred in every case over making new accounts. These cases include, but are not limited to:\nmaking accounts to comment, diamond or favorite on your submissionsmaking accounts to vote for your servermaking accounts to spam any of the systems (please see those sections for more detailed information)making accounts to bypass bansmaking accounts to impersonate individuals that are not yourself\nFor more information regarding the Terms of Use of Planet Minecraft, please click here.\n\nName ChangesIt is possible to get your username changed on Planet Minecraft. You can do so by visiting your account page. If the name you want is already taken but has not been logged in on or used in over one year, you may file a Ticket to request the name you wish to have.\nThe name change system may only be used for legitimate changes to your Planet Minecraft name. We reserve the right to revert name changes at any time if we deem them inappropriate. Using this system for jokes or other similar purposes are not allowed.\n\nPersonal InformationPlanet Minecraft greatly respects your privacy and our policy is designed to protect that privacy. Specific information about our privacy policy is included below. The current official Privacy Policy located here and should be used if there is any confusion. The privacy policy located at the previous link will take precedence should there be a conflict between these two policies.\nEmailYour email address will never be shared with third parties. Your email address will only be used for account creation, account notices (forgot password and similar) and the occasional site news and announcements which can be opted out of.\n\nPasswordsPlanet Minecraft staff will NEVER ask for your password. For security purposes, it is not possible for anyone to retrieve your password from the database as it is stored in an encrypted form. If anyone requests your password for any reasons, please notify a Super Mod or Admin immediately.\n\nLog FilesPlanet Minecraft uses IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the site, track user's movement, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP Addresses are not publicly??linked to personally identifiable information.\n\n\nPrivate MessagingMessages between members, members and judges, members and moderators should not be shared without the consent of the other person. If there is reason to believe a person(s) may be involved in illegal/inappropriate activities, Super Moderators or Adminwill look into them to determine if the reports are accurate. Findings will not be shared, as per the Privacy Policy stated before. Moderators will not go through your PMs without suspicion of possibly malicious activity.\n\nLinks and External SitesThis web site contains links to other sites. Please be aware that Planet Minecraft is not responsible for the privacy practices of other sites. The privacy statement here only applies to information collected by this website.\n\nAdvertisingPlanet Minecraft uses third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit the website. These companies may use information about your visits to Planet Minecraft and other websites (not including your name, email address, or phone number) to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. For more information about this process, click here.\n\nNotification of ChangesIf the privacy policy is changed for any reason, those changes will be posted in the news area of the site. If there is a change in the way that personally identifiable information is used, this will be disclosed in an email to your email on file. You will be given the choice to accept or deny this change in policy, and the updated policy will not take affect on your information until it is accepted. All information will be used according to the terms of the privacy policy in which it was collected.\n\nNotes and ContactPlanet Minecraft will never, under any circumstances, give away or display your IP address to third parties. Additionally, Planet Minecraft will never sell or transmit email addresses or other personal identifiers to 3rd parties. If you have any questions regarding the privacy policy, please contact the administrators here.\n\n\nBans and Removal of ContentPlanet Minecraft moderators employ a banning system for users who break these rules. Bans vary in length from a temporary ban in the affected section (Chat, Forums, Submissions, Server, etc.) to a permanent site-wide ban. Moderators reserve the right to ban any user as necessary.\nBan rules and reasons vary from section to section on the site. The following sections will detail when, how, and why bans will be given in these sections.\nIf you believe that a moderator has made a mistake in their deliberation, or you feel that their decision was unnecessary or incorrect, please remember that communication is key. Disrespect, flaming, and other disruptive behaviors during your appeal will likely result in your issue being ignored, regardless of correctness. Follow the steps below to appeal your ban:\n\nRemain calm. Moderators are humans - sometimes they will make mistakes.Send a Private Message to the moderator who has banned you or removed your content, do not post about this publicly in the forums, chat, or other submissions.If you do not understand the reason for removal, kindly ask the moderator to explain it to you.Ask them if there is anything that you can do to fix the issue.If the moderator is being disrespectful or you feel as if they are singling you out, please send a message to a moderator of higher rank.\n\n\nOwnershipOnce you create an account, you have ownership of that account. There are some guidelines for accounts and account ownership.\nIf you willingly give your account details to someone else (such as a friend or relative), you are giving them shared ownership of your account. You, the creator of the account, will be held responsible for any actions that occur on the account in this case. If your account is hacked or otherwise compromised, please contact a Supermod and the Admin through the tickets system. They will do what they can to help you repair your account and keep it secure. You will not be held responsible for actions taken by someone who compromised your account if there is sufficient proof that this was the case. Please note that leaving your account logged in does not constitute a compromise of your account, it is your responsibility to maintain the security of your login credentials.\n\nRulesAll members on Planet Minecraft are subject to the same set of rules and guidelines - this includes moderators and special guests. There are no exceptions to rules here for any reason unless otherwise specified.\nUsers may not benefit from their misinterpretation or any ambiguity of a rule herein. These rules are written with a specific interpretation, and deliberately changing their meaning to try to gain an advantage or dispute a claim is not acceptable. These rules are written to be as clear as possible. If there is a gray area, the intentions of the rule will be made clear as the moderators enforce the rule the same regardless of whether you or another user are misinterpreting it.\n\nExperienceExperience points are one of the features that set Planet Minecraft apart from other Minecraft community sites. Your uploads in the projects, skins, texture packs, and mods sections will earn you experience points for your account. Currently, your experience points show your current 'level' and allow you access to different user ranks on the site. The primary purpose of experience points are as a method to show how active you are within the Planet Minecraft community. Users that attempt to game the system and gather experience points without merit will be punished according to the guidelines below. The moderators and Planet Minecraft community do not encourage cheating this system, and therefore cheaters will be punished with having their content removed, receiving temporary bans, and possibly permanent bans. Experience points are meant to be a fun incentive to improve the quality of what is submitted to this site and will not be used competitively in any way.\n\n\nModeratorsThe Planet Minecraft community is managed by a team of volunteers known as moderators. The ranks of the moderators vary, but they all have the same goal: to keep the site clean and safe. The ranks of the moderators correspond to the section of the site that they have power to moderate, and all ranks inherit the capabilities of the ranks below them. No matter what rank a moderator is, from chat to Super Moderator, treat all users and moderators with respect.\nAll moderators are expected to hold themselves to the same rules they are enforcing, plus a few additional rules to prevent them from taking unfair advantage of their positions, and to treat all users fairly and professionally.\nThe current list of moderators and their ranks can be found on the team page. The team page is ordered with the most powerful ranks at the top, with each rank having the capabilities of all of the ranks below it.\nFor information on how moderators handle banning, please see the Accounts section above. For information on how to avoid bans, please read the rules and guidelines on this page.\nChat ModsThe first level of moderator is chat moderator, and most new moderators start here. Chat moderators keep chat civil to the best of their abilities, making sure that users are following the rules and guidelines of chat, not bothering other users, and answering questions to the best of their abilities. Their power is to level \"infractions\". Infractions are warnings (given only in chat, and affecting only chat) for breaking the chat rules and guidelines. Planet Minecraft chat will automatically ban users who have received a certain number of infractions, with the length of the ban increasing as more infractions are given. The chat script can also give infractions automatically for spamming and other activities. Chat moderators can also kick or ban people permanently from chat outright if they are being disruptive or linking to dangerous/illegal/pornographic URLs. Chat moderators' names will appear teal blue in all areas of the site.\n\nForum ModsThe second level of moderator is forum moderator. Generally, forum mods are promoted from chat mods, but there are exceptions. Forum moderators handle reported posts and threads, ensure that the forum threads and posts follow the rules, ensure that users are not flaming or trolling, and ensure that no post contain links to anything dangerous or illegal. Forum mods can move, delete, edit, merge, and lock posts and topics. Forum mods can also give warnings to users who break the rules and temporarily or permanently ban users for repeated rule breaking. Forum mods can also act as chat mods while in chat. Forum moderators' names will appear green in all areas of the site.\n\nSite ModsThe third level of moderator is site moderator. Generally, site mods are promoted from forum mods, but there are exceptions. Site moderators answer reports submitted by users on submissions that break the rules. Site mods can deactivate submissions to request the author make changes, move submissions to a different section as needed, delete submissions that break the rules, and reinstate submissions that have made the required changes. Site mods can also mass-moderate a user who uploads large numbers of stolen or illegal work by deleting all their submissions instantly. Site mods also have the ability to see if a user's IP address is attached to other Planet Minecraft accounts, to check if a user is creating multiple accounts against the rules outlined above. Lastly, site mods have expanded tools to verify server posts and can check the automated spam detection script for server listings. Site mods can give warnings, temporary, or permanent bans to users in the chat, forum, and submission areas. For all submission-related questions, contact a site mod or submit a ticket. Most site mods are active on the forums, and many can be found in chat. Site moderators' names will appear yellow in all areas of the site.\n\nSuper ModsThe highest rank is super moderator. Super Moderators can perform all moderation abilities of the other moderator ranks, along with expanded powers directly tied to the site. Super Moderators can reset user passwords, change usernames, restore lost submissions, check user email addresses, and answer questions that do not meet the other moderator areas. Super moderators have the authority to speak for the site in the absence of the administrator in most cases, should there be a need. Super moderators' names will appear orange in all areas of the site.\n\nAdmin/DeveloperThe Admin or Developer rank is reserved for Cyprezz, the creator and owner of Planet Minecraft, and Paril, who works for Cyprezz on the site. The Admin has all of the same abilities as the Super Moderators, as well as access to directly interact with the databases on the site, and modify the site itself. Generally, all changes to the site and site functionality have been created by the Admin or Developer, and all changes that are enabled are done so with the full knowledge and authorization of the Admin. The Admin and Developer's names will appear red in all areas of the site.\n\nContest JudgesContest Judges are not moderators for any portion of the site and do not have any of the powers that were mentioned for previous moderator ranks. Contest judges have the ability to disqualify a submission from a currently running contest, ban a member from entering another submission in the contest for repeatedly breaking contest rules, and when the contest is in judging mode, score the contest submissions to determine the final winners of the contest. Site mods have the same ability to disqualify entries from a contest. This rank is not mutually exclusive to an actual moderator rank, and in the case of a moderator also being a judge, the moderator rank will be displayed. For users that only have the Contest Judge distinction, they will show as a contest judge. Judge names will appear purple in all areas of the site during the time of the contest, but will remain in place in the forums after judging is over.\n\nHow do I become moderator?New moderators are chosen based on their maturity, activity (how much they visit and contribute to the site), whether or not they actively file reports (in the chat room, forums and site) and their personality as a whole. There is no application process, you will be contacted if you have been chosen. 'Hinting' at how much you deserve to be a staff member and harassing existing staff members about promoting you will result in you never obtaining a moderator rank. Please keep this in mind.\n\n\nEtiquetteRespect and SafetyIt is not acceptable to insult, harass, or flame other users on Planet Minecraft. Please be patient and respectful towards others, even if they are not showing the same courtesy towards you. If you are being flamed, please contact a staff member through the tickets system and they will resolve the issue. If another user is leaving insulting comments on your work, delete their comments and add them to your ignore list. Users on your ignore list cannot comment on your submissions, nor can they reply to comments you leave on other submissions. You can do this by selecting the \"Delete and add to ignore list\" option that appears when removing the comment. Retaliation will not be tolerated.\nTo further protect users from possible danger such as epilepsy, do not post any images that flash, make various and/or loud noises or a combination of the two. This is to prevent any epileptic attack that could strike any user that may have the condition from possible harm. In addition, it is also to prevent anyone from weak hearts or might be prone to anxiety attacts from suffering any medical injury that might be fatal.\n\n\nProfanityNo profanity of any kind is allowed on Planet Minecraft. This includes swearing as well as the discussion of inappropriate topics. Certain slang such as abbreviations meant to convey swears are included in this, regardless of whether or not you believe you censored yourself enough. The use of * (asterisks) or $#!&(symbol mashing) to censor words is still deemed as evasion of the profanity rule. If you have nothing to hide, don't censor the word. Discussions or debates deemed controversial in nature are also banned from the site. There's a time and a place for everything, and a family-friendly Minecraft fan site isn't the place for heavily opinionated, political, religious, etc. arguments. This rule applies across all visible areas of the site including submission comments, submissions themselves, the forums, the chatroom, etc.\n\n\nOnly English on SitePlanet Minecraft is a site accessed by thousands of users and hosted in the United States. English is the primary language for most people viewing and uploading submissions, do not speak or submit descriptions solely in another language. This is to make moderation easier as well as making it easier for viewers to read about a project's description.\n\nBlacklistsDo not, under any circumstances, post a thread, submission, forum post, or chat entry complaining about abuse or other wrong-doing of a specific server, Minecraft player, or Planet Minecraft user. If someone has wronged you by breaking a Planet Minecraft rule, report them using the regular reporting channels or contact a moderator for the section that the issue took place in. Planet Minecraft is not responsible for the conduct of any Minecraft server or player. Complaining publicly will not resolve the issue and is not tolerated.\n\nMinimoddingActing as if in a position of power to ban, pointing out that a member has broken a rule, requesting a Moderator action publicly or any similar practices is called Minimodding, or Minimod for short. This causes more fights to break out as people don't have the ability, but act as though they have real authority.\n\nUsing Planet Minecraft to organize teamsAs Planet Minecraft is a large website, it is a good place for users who wish to start a group or team. Users are encouraged to use the community to help produce new, original content. There are a few guidelines to keep in mind if you want to use Planet Minecraft as a medium for starting a group or team.\nAdvertising cheating, spamming, hacking or griefing groups is not allowed.You may only advertise groups if they are contributing to the community rather than taking away from it.Use the proper area of the forums or chat to post about recruitment, do not use the submissions section.\n\n\nAdvertising your Planet Minecraft workAdvertising on Planet Minecraft is an easy and useful tool to promote your work publicly. There are rules that you must abide by when advertising your work. First and foremost, the ability to advertise is not permission to spam your submission or server all over the site or forums. Doing so will result in a ban and the submission being disabled or removed. Second, do not double post, this is considered spam and may incur bans to your account. Double posting also includes creating separate submissions for consecutive updates of the same project or work. If you have worked further on a previous submission, update the original submission and add an entry to the update log. Finally, when advertising in chat you can only advertise once every 15 minutes. Having other people advertise your submissions for you to circumvent this 15 minute limit is considered spam and will not be tolerated. Moving between rooms in chat in order to advertise more often than allowed is forbidden and will result in harsher punishments. Failing to comply by these rules will result in infractions and chat bans being placed on your account.\n\nForbidden Advertising PracticesThere are several methods in which you may advertise your work as listed above. The following list is a sample of practices that will result in the removal of submissions and/or bans placed on your account. This is a non-exhaustive list! While we try to account for everything, please contact us if you are unsure if your specific situation would be against our rules.\n(in the list below, \"XP\" refers to diamonds, favorites, comments or views. Subscriptions are also included in this, though they don't provide experience points)\nRequesting XP via questions/polls (\"diamond if you agree\")Providing rewards for XPCoerce users with potential updates or new content if they give you XP/you reach a specific milestone.Forcing users to give your submission XP (or votes, in the case of servers; voting must be optional) via an in-game link or other similar systems.Trading XP or subscriptions with other users (i.e. Sub-for-sub, Diamond-for-Diamond, etc.)Using bots of any kind (including advertising in chat) for boosting your XPUsing additional accounts to give XP to your submissionsUse any exploit or glitch in the system to alter your statsGiving XP as a prize in community contests\n\n\nAdvertising External Websites/Commercial AdvertisingThe term 'commercial activity' mentioned in the following section includes any action involving monetary transactions, whether it is the user selling or buying a product/service. Exceptions can be made (think of charities), but they're very rare and you should not expect to have one.\n\nThe use of Planet Minecraft to obtain free advertising or to promote other websites is strictly forbidden. This includes, but is not limited to, posting referral links to other websites. Posting on the site, forums, or chatroom is for non-commercial purposes only. You may not post in any manner which promotes, or is intended to promote or generate revenue, for a business enterprise, or commercial activity. This includes, but is not limited to, individuals selling items, persuading a user to endorse a page on a social media site in return for reward or gain, or posting through link shortening services such as AdFly. For acceptable use of AdFly, please see the appropriate section below under the Submission Guidelines. Posting advertising content such as this is prohibited in all areas of the site, including forum signatures and your about me section, and ignoring this guideline will result in a ban. Posting advertisements for any site that is intended to perform a service that Planet Minecraft is intended to perform, such as server listing, is not permitted.\nIllegal activitiesBelow is a list of any activity that would be qualified as illegal due to legal liabilities and possible financial harm.\nAny references to drugs; use, selling, distributing, or role playingGambling of any kind including Bitcoin or Bit VegasRoleplaying sexual or pornographic scenesPromoting racism, sexism, or hate groupsEncourage stealing/unauthorized reproduction or copying, thievery, or deceiving practicesDiscussion of hacking/exploiting\n\n\nYou are allowed to list official websites for your server in the submission for that server, server threads in the forum, your signature, and in the correct room of Planet Minecraft Chat.\nPosting links to virused websites, scam sites that advertise free Minecraft accounts, links to servers that promote gambling, jump scares, websites that could cause seizures, or links to pornography or illegal content will result in a permanent ban.\n\n\nChatroom GuidelinesThe chatroom is provided for Planet Minecraft users to get to know each other, discuss ideas, speak to the moderators who are online, share their work on Planet Minecraft, and promote their servers. There are several different chat rooms available, and certain activities are only allowed in certain rooms. Please check the Rules on the chatroom page for more information.\nIf you receive an infractionfor breaking the rules of chat, you will receive a notification. After receiving three infraction points, a user will be automatically kicked from chat for a period of time. Subsequent kicks due to infractions will be longer and eventually result in a permanent ban. Chat moderators can immediately kick or ban a user from chat at their own discretion according to the rules listed above.\nForum GuidelinesPurposeThe forums are a place to have different discussions with other Minecraft players, ask questions about the site and game, talk about forming groups and videos, and joining other players in making wonderful content. The specific guidelines for using the forums are below.\n\nSectionsThe forums are broken up into a large number of sections. Each section has a specific set of subforums to help you find the exact place to post your question, comment, or request. The sections that are available on the forums are as follows:\nThe SiteThe Site section of the forums houses the Rules and FAQs, News and Announcements, and the Site Discussion and Support subforums. The Rules and FAQs subforum is designed to provide you with easy access to find all of the rules on the site, as well as some guides on using the different site features. The News and Announcements subforum contains any announcements or news about new features, contests, and changes to the site that might take place, such as the posting of these new rules, or adding the ability to change your forum theme.

Items that are deleted for breaking the rules will go to these subforums. Note that this section is not visible to members below the rank of forum moderator.\n\n\nGeneral RulesThe forums follow the same rules regarding respect of the other members as the rest of the site. Please see the list of rules for the chatroom for the general guidelines of behavior on the forums. In addition to those items, there are the following rules:\nDo not make more than one thread for the same topic, question, or request. Posting twice in the same subforum or one time in several different subforums about the same topic is against the rules.Do not spam the forums to increase your post count.Do not post threads outside of the section that they belong in. If you have questions on where to post, ask.Do not use excessive formatting in your post such as colors, icons, images, links, or spoiler tags.Do not post threads about the misconduct of another member or player such as ban lists, moderation disputes, or arguments with other players.Do not divert discussion from the main topic of the thread.Do not bump more than once in a 24 hour period. A \"bump\" is a post that does not contribute to the thread at hand, and whose aim is to move a thread to the top of the recent posts in the forum (ex. \"Anyone?\", \"Still need help!\", \"Hello?\", \"Bump\"). Any reply can bump a thread however. You should only bump a thread if 24 hours has passed since the last post/reply, including the original post, regardless of if the post was yours or if it was or wasn't a \"bump\".\n\n\nReportingThe following guidelines are to help you when reporting something on the forums, as well as to steer you away from things that can get your post moved or deleted.\nHow to Report SomethingIf you see a post that goes against these rules and the guidelines listed below, please click on the Report button indicated by the triangle with the '!' in it. Select the appropriate reason for the report and provide a detailed description of the issue and then click submit so that a Moderator can handle the problem.\n\nI want to make a new thread about XYZFirst, hold up. We know that you have a brilliant suggestion, idea, or thought, but please double check to see if you have a mind clone somewhere who has already made a post about that issue. It is much better for you to share your thoughts where other people are already having a discussion, and you may find information that someone else has already posted that will answer your question or make you think differently. We encourage open discussion (as long as it remains appropriate) and hope that people will work on discussion together instead of everyone trying to be the first post.\n\nA moderator or user did something I don't like!While you may want to rant about what someone has done, we do not allow that on the forums. If you have problems with a user, we have options that will allow you to block users from commenting on your submissions or contacting you so that you do not need to hear from them (these functions do not work against moderators for obvious reasons). If you are having a problem with a moderator, please contact a Super Moderator and respectfully explain the issue. Do not try to contact the developers as they will not reply to such messages.\n\nSomeone posted in the wrong section of the forumsSometimes people get mixed up over where to post something on the forums, and that is ok. When that happens, kindly let a moderator know so that they can move the thread to the appropriate location. The only reason someone will be punished is if they intentionally post in the wrong area.\n\nSomeone posted something inappropriateReport any posts that contain inappropriate content immediately so that we can correct the issue as soon as possible. We follow the same guidelines for the forums as we do for general submissions and we will deal harshly with those who post inappropriate content in the forum area.\n\nMy post disappeared, what happened?First, make sure that your post was not moved for being in the wrong section or combined with a similar thread on the forums. As mentioned above, these things sometimes happen and if so your post can move. If you had a post that was inappropriate, or made on an inappropriate discussion, there is a chance that the post or thread was deleted or moved to our moderator archive for evidence. You have the ability to search all of your posts from your forum profile as a last resort, with the most recent posts returning at the top.\n\n\n\nSubmission GuidelinesThe Prime DirectiveThe primary purpose for the Submissions area of Planet Minecraft is to allow users to share their original creations with other Minecraft players around the world. This requires that you follow our primary rule regarding content, which is that all content must be created by you. If you submit content that was not created entirely by you, the submission will be deleted and you will be banned according to the guidelines listed below.\nUnoriginal ContentThe following list is a partial list of different ways of creating content that are not original work. Interpretation of these items is based on the consensus of the mod team and will be used if there is confusion.\nGenerating content with a programTracing an existing workUsing parts of an existing work in your own work, also called remixing\n\n\nEdited ContentWhen you are modifying a work that was created by someone else, you absolutely must follow the guidelines below. Failure to do so will be treated as stolen content and will result in the removal of the submission and a ban placed on your account. Follow the guidelines below if you would like to create a modified version of someone else's work. Modified work is not allowed in any form in the Skin section, regardless of the following guidelines.\n\nAll modified content must have the permission of the original creator to modify or use the work. Proof must be provided at the top of the submission and be either specific to you, or broad towards all users in the community. Stating who originally made the work is not permission, and you are never allowed to post someone else's work on their behalf, regardless of permission.You must change a significant portion of the work. The general rule of thumb is that if it is not very obvious that the creation is different, the item is not allowed. This also includes changes made to your own submissions such as multiple colors of the same skin, which should all be loaded to the same submission.\n\n\nGreenlight ProcessTo prevent spam, any user posting a mod or texture pack must be level 2 or higher. If you only create mods or texture packs and would like to request access to post your mods at level 1, read the following instructions. Please note that part of the greenlight process is verifying that your modification or texture pack does not fall under the categories listed above as Unacceptable. To submit a request for greenlight, please provide the following information when you upload your submission.\nModsA link to a complete writeup of the mod and what it does, with a download link. This can be somewhere such as the MC Forums or a wiki for the mod.A complete list of all new recipes and items, if any, with pictures.Pictures and descriptions of any new interfaces added by the mod.A description of all new mobs added by the mod, if any, with pictures.A detailed description of any new mechanics that are added by the mod, including pictures if possible.\n\nTexture packsA link to your working texture pack.A complete list of textures that were changed either in the description or with pictures.Pictures and description to accurately present your submission to the community.\n\nPlease note that we cannot install mods and texture packs for testing security reasons and the amount of time needed to properly examine all of the new content in a acceptable mod or texture pack is much greater than that needed to read a well written description of the submission's additions and changes. Remember that we want information on all of the components of the mod or texture pack, so do not include information such as \"you will know when you see it\" or other mysterious comments.\nI am the Original Author, though!There are times when a member from Minecraft Forums wishes to join ours and upload their work here. To prevent impersonation, it would be helpful to message a Site Moderator if you are indeed the true mod author or texture pack artist.\n\n\n\nOffensive CharactersThere are certain characters that are offensive or inappropriate for posting on the Planet Minecraft community that will be deleted if found. In certain specific instances such as for educationally purposes or in historical contexts, the characters or topics listed below may be permitted. However for all other situations, they are not allowed to be posted on Planet Minecraft. This list is subject to change:\nAdolf Hitler and the Nazi PartyOsama bin LadenPedobearNude or Explicit charactersRacist or stereotypical characters\nThe allowed use of any of these characters or topics in a submission must first be approved by a moderator beforecreating the submission. To do this, submit a ticketexplaining in full how the character/topic will be used and provide any necessary supporting materials to be as clear as possible. Using the character/topic differently than described in your ticket or using it if your request has been denied will result in a ban and the deletion of your submission.\n\nAdflyOnly once you have reached level 20, will you be able to post adf.ly links in your download boxes for your submissions. The use of adf.ly links is prohibited for users that are below level 20. If adf.ly links are found on your submissions, the submission will be disabled until they are removed. If they are repeatedly used after this, you will be banned. Adf.ly links can only be used to link content that is 100% yours. If you do choose to use adf.ly or a similar service, please include a direct download link as well.\n\nUpdate LogThe update log is only to be used for major updates, changes, or additions to your submission. This includes large changes or additions to blocks in projects, pixels and textures in skins and packs, text in blogs, adding a download for the first time, etc. Listing small changes is considered update log abuse and repeated abuse will result in the deletion of your submission(s). This includes but is not limited to:\nMinor title/description/content changesAdding or editing videos, pictures, or banners that do not show a substantial change in the contentAnnouncements that are not updatesAdvertisements for server or other submissionsBumping a submission/blank logs\nNote: The Update log does not bump server submissions. The Bump Submission button is there for that purpose instead. You can only bump your server submission once every 24 hours.\n\nBanning GuidelinesThe following list is the general guidelines that the moderation team will follow when providing bans to players for breaking these rules. These are not set in stone and the moderator's judgement will be used in the case of extensive rule breaking or repeated offenses. Please note that offenses are where an item is removed for breaking a rule, not when an item is disabled to change a mistake. Site bans are separate from forum bans and will not prevent access or posting on the forum. To contest a ban or deletion, please respectfully contact the moderator that remove the submission. There are a number of things that can result in higher bans than those listed below being given, including but not limited to, posting content that was previously removed, posting stolen content in a site contest, posting a large number of rule breaking items, and posting certain types of content. Certain rules will result in an immidiate permanent ban, such as posting viruses, pornagraphic material, and other inapropriate or dangerous content. Leniency may be granted for mistakes based on the time since the last ban.\n1st Offense: You will receive a 1 day ban from submitting on the site.2nd Offense: A 3 day ban will be provided for a second offense.3rd Offense: A week ban will be provided for a third offense.4th Offense: 4th Offenses will result in a 2 week ban from the site.5th Offense: The 5th offense will result in a month ban, this is the last straw.6th Offense: A permanent ban is assigned at the 6th offense, preventing further submission to the site.\n\nWhen in DoubtIf you are not sure about a submission that you have created, contact a Site Moderator and ask.\n\n\nBlogs\nWhat is a Planet Minecraft blogUnlike some of the definitions present on the internet, a \"blog\", on Planet Minecraft, is defined as a piece of written content, that brings a significant contribution to either Minecraft, the Minecraft community, the Planet Minecraft community, or Planet Minecraft itself. Items that do not meet this criteria may still be allowed in the forums, though care should be taken to make sure that they go in the correct section, which may be listed above. Blogs must be at least 350 characters to be posted to prevent some spam. This is only slightly longer than the first paragraph in these rules. Episodic content must be posted all in one blog, the only exception to this is when your submission exceeds 65535 characters.\n\n\nAcceptable BlogsThe following categories of blog are acceptable in the Blog section. Anything outside of these categories either belongs in the forums or does not belong on Planet Minecraft.\nTutorials: These are blogs that are meant to teach people something.Art: Drawings, paintings, and comics are considered written content. However, there are a couple of minor limitations. You are allowed only one art blog, and an art blog must have more than one piece of art in it. Usual spam rules apply, as always.Vlogs/Let's Plays: Videos on their own are considered a medium of written content. Please note however that writing a short description of the video is recommended, so to not limit the readability.Reviews: These blogs provide a constructive opinion about a game, Minecraft feature, server, or other item. Using reviews as a way to advertise submissions, servers, etc. is considered spam and must be taken to the forums. In order to qualify as a review, you should include what you like about the item, what you didn't like, and a possible score or even recommendation about it. Slander is not tolerated and will result in a ban.Journals/Experiences: Relating what happened to you in your Minecraft world, sharing your feelings and events that happened to you either in the game or while on a server.Articles/Opinions: These blogs include research and well-thought ideas, or opinions about Minecraft, Planet Minecraft, or the community. Slander is not tolerated and will result in a ban.Stories: Creations made of the written word with the purpose to entertain with fantastic events that don't normally happen in the real world. Creating fictions to blacklist, attack, flame someone will not be tolerated and will result in the story being removed.Constructive Criticism: A blog in which you constructively criticise an individual/object/thing, this is different to a \"rant\" (See Below). Constructive criticism is defined as a piece of work that picks apart and critiques a person or thing and possibly gives advice on how this person/thing could change. Slander, or the misrepresentation of the person or thing, is not tolerated and will result in a ban.Interviews: A blog type in which a person (interviewer) asks another (interviewee) a series of questions relating to their life and personality. It must be a living, breathing person and not a fake item, block, creature, or concept. This includes Steves, Herobrines, Creepers, etc. Interviews with yourself are introductions and belong in the forums as there is already a section dedicated for members to know you better. As a note, inappropriate questions or those that reveal personal information are not allowed\n\n\nUnacceptable BlogsThe following is a list of the content that are no longer considered blogs for the Blog section of Planet Minecraft and instead belong in the Planet Minecraft forums.\nAdvertisements: Blogs solely to advertise a server, other submissions, youtube channels, or forum threads are considered Spam. Creating blog posts to advertise another member or their submissions are also not allowed as blogs and should be posted in the forums instead.Spam/Nonsense/Random: The making of a blog by the slamming of the keyboard, the tying of a single/few characters, not-words, sentences that make no sense, follow any order or a character(s) pressed to reach the minimum limit is considered spam. These types of blogs require minimal effort and are, therefore, not blogs which are written pieces of content that provide constructive feedback to the community.Subscriber/Introduction Blogs: These submissions do not provide any useful content to the community. There is a section in the forums for introductions and subscriber blogs do not provide something additional to the work that was already provided.Recruitment/Teams/Groups: Recruitment, Teams, and Groups are not allowed within the blog section, there is an area of the forums specifically dedicated to this.Contests: There is a section of the forums dedicated to player-created contests.Shops & Requests: There are two sections of the forums dedicated to this. One being for members requesting stuff to be created and one for members to take requests.Questions: Blogs are not the place to ask questions or ask for help. Please post them in the forums under their correct section.Skin Series: These are only re-advertisements of previous skins created. These do not belong in blogs. Post them in the Skinning section of the forums.Blacklist/Member Complaints: Creating lists or blogs to attack, harass, or demean users, organizations or groups will not be tolerated and will result in a ban. Making a blog about a Moderator's removal or decision will also not be tolerated and will result in a removal of the submission. If you have a problem, contact the Moderator in question or in general to bring up questions and/or concerns you may have. You can find the full team here.Specials and Announcements: Reaching any form of milestone such as a certain number of subscribers, time since registration with the site, etc. is not a reason to create a blog. Planet Minecraft is not a social media application and that sort of information should be kept in the \"About Me\" section of your profile.Site Complaints and Petitions: If you have any issue with the site, its content, its moderators or its users then do not create a blog to complain about it or appeal against it. The same applies to petitions to make changes to the site or anything in it as these will in no way encourage the developers or moderators to make the change that you have suggested. If you have a complaint, message one of the Site Moderators or Super Moderators and if you have a petition to make then please post it in the forums.Rants: Blogs designed to vent anger, frustration, and/or disappointment in a person, game, product, submission, or mechanic. These do not provide a significant contribution to the site other than to release steam over something that you do not agree with or agree with while others might disagree.Lists: Creating Blogs such as 100 ways to Die in Minecraft, Top 5 Texture Packs of 2014, and similar lists are not allowed. It takes minimal effort and would be better discussion for the forums as others may have differing opinions on what is the best or worst of any given subject. This also includes listing new features added to the game.\n\n\n\nModifications\nWhat is a mod?On Planet Minecraft the term Mod, which is short for Modification, is used as a general catch-all term for content created that uses programming and/or scripting languages to perform tasks. This includes Minecraft mods, Bukkit Plugins, and external software related to Minecraft. Software outside of these categories is not allowed.\n\nUnacceptable ModsThere are several types of submissions that may appear to meet the definition of a mod that are not allowed on Planet Minecraft. This includes, but is not limited to:\nMod Packs: These almost always include content that is pulled from multiple sources and is not allowed. If you are the sole author of all of the mods in the modpack, you may post one as long as none of the mods are posted on Planet Minecraft individually.Simple Mods: These submissions are mods that do not add new functionality to Minecraft, or simply add functions designed to allow cheating. Mods such as new tools, ores, mobs, or recipes for things like diamonds generally fall into this category if they are not adding something new to the game.Generated Mods: Mods created by software, such as a program to make new human mobs from a skin, or similar, are not allowed. Please see the guideline about program-generated content above.Inappropriate Mods: Mods that reference inappropriate content such as drugs, illegal activity, nudity, etc. are not allowed.Cheats: Mods that are designed to assist in cheating (X-Ray, free items, dirt to diamonds, etc.) are not allowed.Hacks/Viruses: Any mod that is posted to steal account information, bypass the account authentication process, or perform any function against the Minecraft Terms of Service or is otherwise illegal is not allowed and will result in an immediate and permanent ban for the 1st Offense.Shaderpacks: Anything that uses vertex and fragment shaders.Installers/Launchers:No installers that contain malware/adware are allowed, and there must be a direct download link visible on the page.Addons: Addon mods are not allowed; they are commonly just configuration files.\n\n\n\nProjects\nWhat is a Planet Minecraft project?A project is a collection of blocks for Minecraft and can be posted as a complete world save, a schematic, or simply a set of images showing it off. There are some minimum guidelines that must be followed that are outlined below.\n\nMinimal Project RequrimentsA suitable title related to your project.In-game screenshots of your project to show members what you have created.A clear Description explaining the project and what it is.If the project requires specific modifications to function, it is highly recommended that you supply links to the modifications required to run it. You are not required to provide support for these modifications, but to reduce user confusion (which may lead to false reports), you should always mark what modifications the project requires.\n\n\nTools for BuildingYou can use assistive third-party tools such as MCEdit, WorldEdit, and VoxelSniper to create your project as they are simply tools to aid in the creation of the content. Tools such as Spritecraft or binvox that convert an image or model into a minecraft build are not allowed as they are generating the content from an existing work that is very likely not yours.\n\nUnacceptable ProjectsThe following is a partial list of submissions that are not allowed in the Projects section of Planet Minecraft. These submissions will be deleted and you will be banned.\nNot Blocks: Anything that is not a construction built in the game is not allowed. These include, but are not limited to, animations, drawings, and/or let's plays.Program-Generated Content: Anything that is created by a third-party tool (mod, program, etc.) using the software to create something from a pre-existing template or model is not allowed. This includes but is not limited to importing CAD models, images, or other data is prohibited. It is acceptable to start with an existing heightmap for custom terrain, but you must perform significant alteration beyond simply importing the data and allowing the tool to generate the land. Proof that a project follows this guideline is required and can be requested in the case of a dispute.Default Worlds, Amplified Worlds, Seeds and Flatmaps: Default Worlds and Amplified are great to show off if you generate a cool spawn, but they are not by themselves projects and require additional user created content to be considered a project. Seeds and flatmap presets are simply a string of characters used to generate a world to specific settings. While you are certainly allowed to share the seed or flatmap setting that was used in your world with your epic castle, you are not allowed to post a seed or flatmap by itself. The land created by a seed or flatmap config is generated solely by the game and is considered program-generated content.Pixel Art: While it is possible to create original pixel art, almost all pixel art is created through software programs like Spritecraft or simply copied from an image by hand. This is against the Program-Generated content and Tracing guidelines. If you have original pixel art that you would like to post, please do so on the forums.\n\n\n\nServers\nWhat is a server?A server is where users are able to play Minecraft multiplayer and in the case of Planet Minecraft, is accessible over the public internet using a verified account. This means that servers that run through VPN services such as Hamachi are not allowed in the Servers section, nor are servers that advertise themselves as being cracked. Servers working through Hamachi or without user authentication can be posted in this forum section.\nTo be postable here on PlanetMinecraft, a server must follow these two basic rules:\nThe server must be uniquely identifyable by its IP/port. We do not support proxy setups such as BungeeCord; if your server's IP/port technically points to multiple servers, the MOTD system will automatically remove any matches.The server must be joinable and playable from the IP/port/hostname in the box. The server must not be a dummy (kicking users asking them to join another server) and it must not have other IPs/hostnames listed on the page to \"join to play\".\n\n\nWho can post a server?Servers can only be posted by the server Owner. We recognize the user that has access to edit the servers properties file to be an owner and such access is required to post a server on Planet Minecraft. Admins, moderators, and other users of a server are not allowed to make a listing on Planet Minecraft for a server that they do not own. Users that create a server listing using false information or to attach another server will have the listing removed and will be banned, with the malicious listing getting a longer ban.\n\nHow many times can a server be posted?Server listings are only allowed once for any given server on Planet Minecraft. While there are controls in place to prevent a server from being posted more than once, if a user is found to be doing so, their server listing will be deleted and their server added to our blacklist, which prevents the server from being posted again.\n\nUnacceptable ServersThe following types of servers will not be allowed on the Planet Minecraft listings in any form.\nIllegal/Inappropriate RP Servers: Servers that promote or roleplay illegal or inappropriate activities such as drug use are not allowed on Planet Minecraft. Posting a server of this type will result in an extended or permanent ban.No Screenshots: Servers without any in-game screenshots of the server itself from in the game are not allowed. Server listings are required to have a minimum level of effort placed into them to be shown on Planet Minecraft and having in-game screenshots allows players to better decide if they would like to join the server.\n\n\nThe Server BlacklistThe server blacklist is a list of servers that are not allowed to post on Planet Minecraft in any form because of prior infractions. This list is private and is only accessible to the Site Mod team and above. This is usually due to repeated spamming or similar actions while ignoring warnings. Posting a blacklisted server on Planet Minecraft will result in the immediate deletion of the server listing and a permanent ban from the site. For this reason, it is important that only the server owner create the listing for the server as it will prevent issues with spamming the server and keep it from being blacklisted. If you are asked to list another person's server, do not do so.\n\nServer DisputesPlanet Minecraft and the Planet Minecraft Moderation team is not responsible for conduct of any user on any server. Reporting a server for banning you will be ignored and could lead to your reporting privaleges being removed. If you have an issue related to the Official Planet Minecraft server, please contact the server Admins, Paril, Zaralith and Cipher_Punk.\n\n\nSkins\nWhat is a skin?A skin is a .png image file used to customize the appearence of the player character in online play and must match the dimensions on the reference skin provided by Mojang. High-resolution skins are not supported on Planet Minecraft and cannot be posted.\n\nPart PickingPart picking is the act of creating a skin by copying portions of another skin that was created by someone else. This action goes against the rule regarding original content and overrides the rules on modified content, which is never allowed in the skin section. Content created using part picking will be deleted.\n\nBanned Skinning ProgramsThere are a number of tools used to create Minecraft skins that are not allowed to be used to create skins submitted to Planet Minecraft because they violate the rules on part picking and provide libraries of parts to use, many taken from popular skins without the original creator's consent. The Global Ban list for skinning tools is given below, though the list does not show all tools that are not allowed.\nNewground's SkinCraftSkinEdit skin creatorMinersNeedCoolShoes ArmouryThe SkinDex skin editorNovaSkin skin creatorminecraftskins.com skin editorSkinsProCreator (iOS platform)\n\n\nAcceptable Skinning ProgramsMany skins are created by hand using normal drawing tools such as Paint.NET, GIMP, Photoshop, and other image editing tools. There are also a few tools specifically designed to be used to create Minecraft skins, including MCSkin3D by Paril. If you have a question about whether a skin making program is allowed, please contact a Site Moderator.\n\nSpam SkinsThere are a number of different types of skins that are considered spam on Planet Minecraft. These skins will be removed when found and the poster banned according to the banning guidelines. These skins include all single color, flat, scribble, or outline skins. If you are not sure if your skin counts as spam, please contact a Site Moderator.\n\nRecolored or Modified SkinsSometimes, a skinner will create several different variations of a skin, perhaps to show a character on several different teams or with several different color styles. This includes, but is not limited to, removing a small portion of skin, adding a piece of clothing or equipment, changing a shirt, and any similar practice. All skins that are created this way must be posted under the same submission, and any skins found breaking this rule will be disabled so that the author can move the skin to a primary submission before being deleted. To add variations on your skin, load the skin variations to an image sharing program and place the links to those skins in your description.\n\nSkin TransparencyMinecraft does not support transparency of any kind on any portion of the base player model and will render transparent portions of the skin as black. This does not include the hat layer which does function with transparency and is transparent in the base skin. Alpha level transparency is not supported in any form within a skin, the alpha levels must be all or nothing. Skins that are submitted with transparent portions on the main template or colored to match the background of the skin previewer will be deleted or blocked.\n\n\nResource Packs\nWhat is a Resource Pack?Resource Packs, called texture packs prior to Minecraft 1.6, are files that change the look and sound of Minecraft. These resource packs can change character and mob skins, block textures, item sprites, particles, sounds, and more.\n\nResource Pack Minimum RequirementsResource Packs that are submitted to Planet Minecraft must meet certain minimum guidelines or they will be disabled or removed. Generally speaking, a significant portion of one of the primary areas that a resource pack covers must be changed before you are allowed to submit the pack. These areas include blocks, items, sounds, and the user interface. The rule of thumb for resource packs is that they must change at least 50% of all blocks or items, or all of the sounds or user interface elements, to be posted. If you are unsure about whether your resource pack meets the allowed guidelines, please contact a Site Moderator.\nResource packs also require in-game screenshots of the pack to show members what you have created.\n\n\nWhat about old Texture Packs?The old Texture Pack format is still accepted on Planet Minecraft, however we recommend that any texture packs that were created prior to the resource pack format be converted if they are updated. Please note that Minecraft versions 1.6 and higher are not able to use the old Texture Pack formats at all. To unstitch and convert normal texture packs created prior to Minecraft 1.5, please use the official tool located here. For HD texture packs or those using old block animations through MCPatcher or Optifine, please use the officially sactioned alternative here. Once the texture pack has been unstitched, convert the textures to a resource pack using the Minecraft Texture Ender, which is located here.\n\nPlaceholdersResource packs that are posted to Planet Minecraft are not allowed to contain any 'placeholder' files. This is generally template files for item or block images, or sounds, usually from the base resources or another resource pack. With the current resource pack format, Minecraft will provide any resources that are not included in the pack using the default resources, which means that there is no reason to include placeholder files.\n\nDisallowed ResourcesThere are certain kinds of resource packs that are not allowed on Planet Minecraft. These resource packs include but are not limited to:\nTransparent block textures or \"X-Ray\" textures for blocks that are not transparentSound files that are copywritten, such as discs playing popular music from outside sourcesMultiple resource packs for different sizes of the same texturesTextures that are recolored/filtered versions of the defaultPacks mostly containing textures that may be considered spam. This includes small, simple textures (such as a \"1x1\" pack) that make up the majority of the resource pack.\n\n\n\nReportingThis section is for basic guidelines and questions regarding reporting submissions from the site. Please note that some items were submitted long ago when some of these guidelines were not yet in place and are valid submissions as long as there are no edits made. Other guidelines are currently being examined (such as multiple skin colors and resource pack resolutions) to see what changes on the site are needed to facilitate that requirement. If any item was grandfathered under this idea, it is safe as long is it is not updated. If something old that does not meet the guidelines is updated, it will be deleted unless the update brings it in line with the current rules. Certain rules such as inappropriate content, original content, and spam are all exempt from grandfathering and will be deleted regardless of age.\nSubmitting a ReportIf you find a submission that does not follow the rules and guidelines outlined here, click on the report button indicated by the flag on the right side of the submission data, and indicate the rule or guideline that has been broken. Once you have indicated what guideline has been violated, provide a detailed description of what you have seen, and include links to any additional evidence, such as original projects for those that are copied or remixed content, and click submit. Reports that do not have supporting information that are not overwhelmingly obvious will be discarded and repeated bad reports may lead to revoking your ability to report submissions.\n\nThey didn't make this, myself or someone else didThe most important thing to do when reporting stolen or remixed content is to provide proof. This means include links to the proof that you have. Please note, some people do post in multiple locations and you should only report those incidents when the user is not the same. Unless an item is universally known/identifyable, your report will be dismissed and ignored. Even if you made the item, include a link to your submission so that we do not need to dig through your profile.\n\nThey used a program to generate thisGenerating content with a program is not allowed. Using tools such as MinerShoes, Novaskin, Mod makers, Picture converters, and other similar programs requires little effort and uses prior work created by others without permission. Using assistive tools such as MCSkin3D, WorldEdit, or MCEdit do not fall under this as they designed to assist a user in their work, not do the work for them.\n\nThis is spamThere are a number of different things that can be spam. Examples include stuff that is intentionally crappy, submissions that require no effort, or items created purely for the purposes of boosting experience. These items are a judgement call for the mods and not all possibilities are listed.\n\nThis is in the wrong categorySometimes submissions are uploaded in wrong area, such as mob skins being uploaded as skins instead of inside a resource pack, or a modification uploaded as a project. Please note that this is usually not a removal offense, just something that is in the wrong place. If a moderator agrees that the item is in the wrong area, it will be moved. Please report content that is in the wrong category if you see it.\n\nThis contains inappropriate contentInappropriate content is anything that contains references to sex, drugs, illegal activities, or recommends those activities. While there are some exceptions to these rules, the average age of our users is in middle school or earlier and we maintain that all content should be something that they would be allowed to see. This item is once again a judgement call from the mods that examine the report, however we work together to maintain the same standards of what is and is not appropriate and discuss anything that is borderline to make sure we are all on the same page.\n\nThe admins of this server are bad or they banned me!Tough, find another server. What happens on a server is not something that we can or want to control. If you find a server that is bad or that has admins that abuse the players, don't stay with them, find another server. If they continue their activities, their server will eventually disappear because nobody wants to play with them.\n\nThis moderator banned me, do I flag all of their stuff?No silly, you find out why they banned you (which will generally be listed as a comment on whatever item they deleted during the ban). Once you know why you were banned, you have 2 options. If you believe that you were banned incorrectly, send a respectful PM to that moderator or to another moderator explaining your case. We are all reasonable and if you prove to us that we made a mistake, we will gladly correct it. Do Not send a PM to a mod telling them how much you hate them and that you are going to contact the admin or someone higher up and get them fired. These sorts of messages will be ignored at best, or you will receive a longer ban and unpleasant reply at worst. We deal with 1000s of submissions and there is always the possibility that we make mistakes, but if you flip out and attack the moderator that made the mistake, we will not want to work with you to correct the issue.\n\n看完以上你跟我说MCBBS版规多？我只想说hhhhhhh（汉化进行中，预计一周内发出来。）\n\n\nIG：某站版规也能搬！\n\n\n\n\n\n"
