This doesn't mean that every Monday there's gonna be a new medieval build, but that every Monday if you refresh your page it is possible that you might find a new one. So that's that, it's not a regular or weekly series. \n\nI originally wanted to create my own medieval building pack / bundle, however I quit and picked up the project several times, so I figured it'd probably be the best solution to just, as soon as I'd built another house, upload it here. Otherwise I presumably wouldn't have finished the project and all the work would've been in vain. \n\nAll right, the buildings I'd like to cover in this series are the following: \n\n- Large houses \n- Normal houses \n- Small houses \n- Church \n- Castle \n- Town hall \n- Market place \n- Training area \n- Windmill \n- Forge \n- Watchtower / Clocktower \n- Graveyard \n- Gate \n- Town walls \n- Library \n\nThese are some ideas I've had - if you have any additions you'd like to see please tell me! I will very likely add them to the list :) \n\nInteriors won't constantly be a part of the builds, but some of them will surely be furnished. So you see, it's really just a fun series. Don't forget to diamond, favourite & subscribe, and see you next time :D \n[book]简单翻译[book]这个上面说的大致意思是作者想要发布一系列的中世纪建筑，这次是第一个建筑-房屋下面的还没有发布的建筑列表\n下面是本人自己的评价以及搬运的原因[diamond_gem]搬运理由[diamond_gem]这个作者的实力不需要怀疑，他所做的中世纪房屋简单但是有内容很好的利用了半砖和台阶，颜色搭配也非常的舒服给人感觉就是建筑虽然小，但是有很多的内容[painting]图片欣赏[painting]\n\n[board]作者信息[board]*点击图片跳转作者个人详细介绍*\n\n更多搬运建筑请到：【临时工搬运】索引贴去寻找\n",
