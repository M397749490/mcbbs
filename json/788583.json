The forge fluid registry has a fatal flaw in that it can change the default fluid on world load, but only one forge bucket will be baked and only one fluid texture will be stitched into the texture atlas. This results in black and purple quilt textures on fluid tanks if two mods add the same fluid (Steam, Oil, Molten Metals, ...). This mod doesn't solve the discrepancy between the world default and the load default, it simply stitches ALL fluid textures to ensure there will be a texture to render even if the world default doesn't match the load default.\nThis will work for every mod that does not cache their own fluid texture for rendering purpose (i.e Embers and probably anything written by LordMau5)\ntl;dr if you have two mods installed that add the same oil you won't get purple and black textures anymore\n一大堆话，简单来说，就是：让Minecraft不再拥有紫黑方块，当两个方块的材质发生冲突后，不会出现紫黑方块这种现象，而是将它们的材质拼接在一起。它只会将液体纹理拼接起来，以确保在默认情况下，世界也会出现纹理，而不会受到模组影响。\n\n\n封面英文翻译：走开，我讨厌画缩略图  #run\n\n作者：BordListian\nCurseForge：点击下载\n网盘备用：点击进入\n",
