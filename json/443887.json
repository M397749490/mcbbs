It is inspired by the Singleplayer Commands mod, which isn't developed further. I really liked this mod and it was the only mod I used extensively, but since it isn't developed anymore, I decided to write my own commands mod. Singleplayer Commands had to be entirely rewritten in the 1.3 update, because since this update, singleplayer is just an internal server and many commands had to be removed. I adopted many of the currently working commands but I also reimplemented many of the commands which have been removed. Nevertheless this mod is NOT just an update for Singleplayer Commands, I also added new commands, but the biggest difference is the way how the mod works. In contrast to Singleplayer Commands, you don't have to modify your minecraft.jar, because this mod is a Forge mod. This mod also uses the client-server model and is therefore NOT only restricted to singleplayer, you can also use it on a Forge Server.\n\n\n\n\n[book]更新日志[book]\n\n1.8-2.3\nUpdate of version 1.7.10-1.3 to Minecraft Version 1.8\n\n1.8-2.2Update of version 1.7.10-1.2 to Minecraft Version 1.8\n\n1.8-2.1Update of version 1.7.10-1.1 to Minecraft Version 1.8\n\n1.8-2.0Update of version 1.7.10-1.0 to Minecraft Version 1.8\n\n1.7.10-1.2- Added command 'blocklight', which allows you to set the light level for each block- Added command 'calc', which is a basic calculator (brackets, plus, minus, modulo, multiply, divide and power)- Added command 'ignorespawn', which allows to prevent entities from spawning\n\n1.7.10-1.2- Improved Command Block Support (if the player has the mod installed client side, client commands work too)- Added the \"music\" command (allows to play, skip and stop music)- Switched to an event driven network system.\n\n1.7.10-1.1Added Command Block Support. Use Target Selectors (e.g. \"@p[name=Player1,name=Player2,..]\") as LAST Argument to target players. You don't need to specify players for every command (e.g. the \"dodrops\" command does not need a player)\n\n1.7.10-1.0Initital release\n\n\n\n\n[board]一个命令列表（可能需要翻墙）\n\n\n下载\n\n\n\n\nMoreCommands-1.7.10-1.3.jar\n(441.9 KB, 下载次数: 19126)\n\n\n\n2015-5-10 15:31 上传\n点击文件名下载附件\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMoreCommands-1.8-2.3.jar\n(443.14 KB, 下载次数: 8054)\n\n\n\n2015-5-10 15:31 上传\n点击文件名下载附件\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[redstone_torch]安装[redstone_torch]下载Forge下载Mod本体把Mod拖入.minecraft\\mods文件夹\n\n\n\n\nEnd\n\n\n\n\n",
