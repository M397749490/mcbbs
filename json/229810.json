    "txt_content": "原文：The Trap Of Total Obliteration\n\nIf your mate activates this trap successfully, he is as good as banned. The trap consists of any switch (pressure plate is probably the best one) and two sticky pistons. Upon activation the pistons start to repeatedly move after one another with the victim being between them. This causes the player to move so fast that even with a diamond pickaxe he/she won't be able to break free. Make sure that the space is closed. The harder the material you use is, the better but do note that pistons can't move obsidian or bedrock. NOTE: not confirmed if you can break free from a stone made trap with a diamond pickaxe enchanted with efficiency.\n译文：闭塞粘性陷阱\n\n\n如果你的目标成功激活了这个陷阱，他无异于被禁止做任何行动。陷阱包括任何开关（压力板大概是最好的一个选择）（白桑：个人觉得绊线好像也可以）和两个粘性活塞。在激活活塞开始反复运作后，目标会在活塞之间被夹着移动。这使目标移动很快，即使他/她有一个钻石镐也无法挣脱。确保你给予目标的空间是封闭的，以及你所用的材料硬度足够高，但注意活塞不能移动黑曜石或基岩。注：不确定是否你可以用附魔了挖掘效率的钻石镐摆脱一个石头制成的闭塞粘性陷阱。\n文句较为生硬，这不怪我，最近写作文也这样...\n\n\n",
