When considering what I would most like to see, the far-fetched idea of Minecraft's creator (Notch) sitting down and interviewing Bethesda's game director (Todd Howard) immediately sprang to mind. In a dark meeting room inside Bethesda's booth on the show floor, with the bass from the nearby Prey 2 demo bleeding through the walls, I set the cameras up and let the conversation flow. From Notch's love of Oblivion to Todd Howard's opinion on the greatest game ending of all time, watch the video to see these two gaming luminaries pick each others minds on the potential within their own games as well as the wider gaming landscape.\n\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWsGOXB_pn4\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yAsUuJm9Q\n\n\nps：Todd Howard是一个设计师，制作人，总监，Bethesda现在的执行制作人，Skyrim的宣布着，Bethesda的灵魂人物……总之就是很可爱的一个大男孩XD\nNotch就无需我介绍了\n\n两位大大面对面的交流会带来怎样的头脑风暴呢XD\n\n\n\n",
