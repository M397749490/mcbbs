This cannot be undone (yet).\n- Fixed an issue with rotating copied items and later finding them scrambled.\n\nstable30:\n- Added all three variations of hidden silverfish blocks: Stone, Cobblestone, Stone Brick\n- Added graphics for all four kinds of stairs\n- Added rotation info for the new stairs, Chests, and Vines\n- Replacing different types of stairs will preserve the stairs' orientation.\n\n- Fixed the Move Player tool not working correctly\n- Fixed the Topsoil brush not working inside caves\n\n- Fixed a problem where the window wouldn't remember its size correctly\n- Fixed a problem where the mouse control became unusable after resizing the window\n- Copy/Import operations now create chunks and copy blocks in a single pass\n- Added more progress bars\n\nstable27:\n- Added Creative/Survival toggle to Create New World and World Info windows.\n- Fixed a problem with missing trees in the chunk generator.\n- Move Player tool now correctly moves players to and from the Nether\n- Move Player tool now jumps to the dimension the player is in.\n\n- Fixed a startup error in reloadVersions\n\n\n\n而且我才发现 history里还没29的信息 我默认了"
