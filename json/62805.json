            "txt_content": "Combat\nThis former wizard retains a wide variety of attacks, which it deploys in three basic phases.\n\nIn the first phase, the lich summons shadowy, invincible duplicates. The lich itself is protected by a rotating ring of shields. Both the lich and the duplicates fire blue-green projectiles that look like ender pearls. Quick-thinking adventurers report that the projectiles can be reflected with a properly-timed sword swing, similar to a ghast's fireballs. During the first phase, the lich can be seen holding a Twilight Scepter. Almost any attack that bypasses armor will remove one of the lich's shields.\n\nThe second phase begins when the lich's shields are depleted. In the second phase, the lich switches to holding a Zombie Summoning scepter, and uses it to to summon an army of zombies to attack the player.\n\nIn the third phase, which begins when the lich runs out of zombies to summon, the lich attacks the player hand-to-hand with a golden sword.\n\n这是wiki上对巫妖的介绍，我鸟文也不好，大意似乎是说第一阶段巫妖会召唤一个无敌的阴影，巫妖自己则被旋转的护盾保护，你大概是打到那个无敌的阴影了。。。"
