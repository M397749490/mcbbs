And while many builders like to go for the wild and fantastical, lots of you are also being influenced by more realistic architecture. Earlier this year we saw Xalima from AndyisYoda, and now we have this, a large-scale Celtic Manor from NotSupere!\n每个人都有自己玩 Minecraft 的风格，这正是这个游戏的美妙之处。很多的建筑师偏爱狂野和梦幻的风格，同样也有很多的人被更加真实的建筑所吸引。今年的早些时候，我们见到了来自 AndyisYoda 的 Xalima，现在我们来聊聊 NotSupere 的这个大比例的凯尔特庄园！\n\nThe size of this build can be hard to appreciate in screens - picture the size of the trees and then scale up accordingly! Plus those two Greek statues in the courtyard aren't people sized either - they're giants!\n这个建筑的尺寸难以在屏幕上欣赏。拍下树的照片，然后照此放大尺寸！加之庭院的两座希腊风格雕塑也不是一般地大，它们称得上是巨型！\n\nA Minecraft builder since 2011, NotSupere is now a member of Athion Build Team, and recently sought to put his own crafting abilities to the test. \"It actually started as almost a challenge to myself,\" he explains to us of his Celtic Manor build. \"Because I had never done large-scale builds. I had only done builds that looked good in-game. So I kind of challenged myself to do a large-scale build.\"\n作为一名2011年就开始在 Minecraft 中建造的玩家，NotSupere 现在是 Athion 建筑团队的一员。最近他在发掘自身的建筑潜能，“这个凯尔特庄园对我而言确实是一项挑战”，他向我们解释道。“因为我从未尝试建造过如此大比例的建筑。我之前只建造过一些在游戏过程中看上去不错的建筑，所以对我而言建造如此大比例的建筑，确实是对自身的一种挑战。”\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen NotSupere first discovered Minecraft, it was in the mean streets of Survival mode, until a friend convinced him to join his creative server. \"My friend was building minimalistic modern at the time. He basically made me get on the server and I just started building and seemed to really like it. I didn't feel like going back to survival.\"\n当 NotSupere 第一次接触 Minecraft 的时候，大家都在玩生存模式，直到在他的一位朋友强烈要求下，他加入他朋友的创造模式的服务器。“我的朋友当时在建造一些简约风格的现代建筑。他帮我进入服务器之后，我便开始并渐渐爱上了建造。从那之后，我再也不想回到生存模式了。”\n\nFast forward a few years and NotSupere challenges himself to this, his first large-scale build. So what fresh problems did raising the scales introduce? Did he have to rethink any building techniques?\n时光荏苒，几年后 NotSupere 开始了这项新的挑战：他自己的第一个大比例建筑。那么如此大的比例将会带来哪些困难呢？他需要重新思考已知的建筑技巧吗？\n\n\"Not really! It was actually a whole lot easier - like, I built that entire build in less than a week. I was actually extremely surprised by how easy it was. It was almost comical how easy it was to do and how much people liked it. Are they lying to me or something?\"\n“实际上并没有，整个过程其实挺简单的。差不多在一个星期之内我就完成了整个建筑。我确实没想到居然会这么顺利。这确实很好笑，整个过程如此容易而又有如此多的人喜欢它。他们该不是逗我开心吧？”\n\nHuh. That was not the answer we were expecting...\n额，这好像并不是我们期待的答案……\n\n\n\nNow before you turn green with envy and start furiously wondering how anyone could find building an entire manor in less than a week easy, note that the project wasn't without it's challenges. \"I did kinda fail on this part actually; making it proportionate,\" concedes NotSupere.\n不过，在你眼红并强烈怀疑怎么会有人能在一周之内建造一个完整的庄园之前，请注意到这项工程并不是毫无挑战性。“实际上整个建筑在比例上是有一些瑕疵的”，NotSupere 坦陈道。\n\n“It was almost comical how easy it was to do and how much people liked it.”\n“这确实很好笑，整个过程如此容易而又有如此多的人喜欢它。”\n\"It looks like a very large build, but if you look at the size of the door compared to the rest of the build, it's actually a very small house - if there was an actual person that lived in there. It looks cool, but as far as actual scale, it wouldn't work. I realised that after I built it!\" Always the way, eh? Still, something learnt for the next one!\n“它看上去像是一个很大的建筑，然而如果你将门的尺寸与建筑的其余部分做对比，你会发现整个建筑其实是个很小的房子，如果真的有人居住在其中的话。它看上去很酷，但是就比例而言，它并没有那么好。在我建造好之后我意识到了这一点。”事情总是这样的，额，我们总还是从中获得了一些可以用于以后建造的经验的。\n\n\n\nBut you don't have to wait to see more of NotSupere's work - you can find his previous projects on his YouTube channel here and follow him on Twitter here. Plus you'll find more great work from Athion Build Team here. Now if you'll excuse us, we're off to sit in the corner and wonder why we can't build something like this in a week. Harumph.\n如果你想欣赏更多 NotSupere 的工作，你可以在他的 YouTube上找到他之前的一些作品，你也可以在 Twitter 上关注他。另外，你还可以在 Athion 建筑团队的网站上找到更多的优秀作品。现在，我想静静——为什么我们不能在一周内做出如此棒的作品呢，哼！\n\nRenders by SphaeraTerra, NotSupere,  Dorsor21 and OnlyDonut\n图片渲染：SphaeraTerra, NotSupere,  Dorsor21 和 OnlyDonut\n",
