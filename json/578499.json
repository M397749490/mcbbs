The style employed is intentionally in the same vein as a rather massive project I have been working on and will be releasing soon, as both of these projects are part of the same universe. There is a somewhat distant steampunk influence going on, though i don't think it could properly be labelled as such. The ship flying in the background on the left in the first render is a small part of the next project I will be uploading, and not properly a part of this one. \n\n图片欣赏\n\n\n\n渲染 by SamangaBuildTeam\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n如果你希望支持本作品，请前往原帖为作者投上一颗钻石[diamond_gem]",
