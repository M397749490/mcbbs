Through its various configuration files it gives the user control over almost every aspect of Minecraft's world generation, allowing you to generate anything from floating islands to cave worlds with no knowledge of Java required. OTG is just an engine, to make use of its functions you must either install a World Preset (see Installing Worlds) or make your own custom World Preset (see Configuration below or in Navigation bar at the top). OTG supports both Spigot (servers) and Forge (servers and single-player).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOTG是一款先进的，完全可定制的世界编辑器。通过其各种配置文件，你可以控制Minecraft的世界生成的几乎每个条件，这个插件允许您生成从浮岛到洞穴世界的任何内容，而不需要Java知识。OTG支持Spigot（服务器）和Forge（服务器和单人游戏）。并且这三个都是同一个文件，就目前来说OTG有属于自己的WIKI和属于自己的官网。是一个在国外十分流行并且附属（mod/插件）众多的超大型免费(插件/mod)就我本人的适用体验来说，并没有好坏之分，如果说EWG是着重于精致的话，那么OTG就是着重于大气的生成器。关键在免费啊\n\n\n鉴于OTG有mod版搬运贴，我也一起贴在这里，要安装mod版的可以移步\nMOD版OTG搬运帖(mcbbs):\n\nMOD地址1MOD地址2 \n\n【OTG可以做什么】\n控制水平高度，调整地形波动\n 创建新的生物群落并控制生物群落，岛屿和大陆的大小\n 导入自定义树和或者其他玩意（建筑）\n 控制每个生物群系的刷怪规则和天气结构\n使用自定义怪物和战利品并且生成大型自定义结构\n自定义的的矿物结构，如矿井，堡垒和村庄\n完全控制世界所有区域和方块：矿石，泥土，植物，地下城，池塘等等\n可定制的洞穴和峡谷\n自定义树叶，水和天空颜色等外观设置（需要OTGmod）\n生成生物群系地图）\n多世界支持（需要独立的插件用来造访这些世界）\n\n\n【OTG地图包】\n\n Biome Bundle（预制世界）\n是一个完全定制好的世界包，里面包含400多个原始生物群落的庞然大物，拥有超过2000个独立地形结构，其中包括定制树木，岩石，洞穴，地下城，村庄等等\n\n2.OTG: Skylands \n空岛\n这是一个定制好的世界包，其中包括和上面差不多数量的生物群戏和地图结构。并且有相互连接的空岛。除此之外是危险的虚空\n \n【其余的附属插件（官方或者非官方）】\n \nOTG：跨世界 （上面提到过的用来跨越OTG的多世界的插件）\nOTG：超平坦 （超平坦的世界+OTG:Biome Bundle）\nOTG：地狱  (看到有人提起，并无详细消息)\nOTG：地牢  (暗无天日的地下城)\nOTG：虚空 （就是空岛生存类型的地图）\nOTG：洞穴探险 （难度非常高的世界，适用于非常硬核的PVP服务器）\nOTG：地图制作师 （并无详细消息）\n···························（还有更多）\n 有些 只是在官网的评论中看到过，有些是官方的附属。这就靠论坛吧友自行**寻找了。\n\n\n\n【OTG效果图】\n  这里是来自 9minecraft的宣传图\n\n\n\n\n\nBiome-Bundle-Mod-Frozen-Forest.jpg (144.51 KB, 下载次数: 1)\n\n下载附件\n\n2019-1-20 17:15 上传\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBiome-Bundle-Mod-Bald-Cypress-Forest.jpg (119.44 KB, 下载次数: 2)\n\n下载附件\n\n2019-1-20 17:15 上传\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBiome-Bundle-Mod-High-Cliffs.jpg (142.92 KB, 下载次数: 2)\n\n下载附件\n\n2019-1-20 17:15 上传\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBiome-Bundle-Mod-Tropical-Rainforest.jpg (107.92 KB, 下载次数: 1)\n\n下载附件\n\n2019-1-20 17:15 上传\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n这里是我安装以后的实际侧视图（无光影）\n\n\n\n\n\nfile_1547975442000.jpg (425.99 KB, 下载次数: 1)\n\n下载附件\n\n2019-1-20 17:10 上传\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfile_1547975442000.jpg (476.19 KB, 下载次数: 2)\n\n下载附件\n\n2019-1-20 17:10 上传\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfile_1547975441000.jpg (454.93 KB, 下载次数: 1)\n\n下载附件\n\n2019-1-20 17:10 上传\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfile_1547975440000.jpg (399.42 KB, 下载次数: 2)\n\n下载附件\n\n2019-1-20 17:10 上传\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfile_1547975440000.jpg (96.63 KB, 下载次数: 1)\n\n下载附件\n\n2019-1-20 17:10 上传\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQQ截图20190120160613.png (290.55 KB, 下载次数: 2)\n\n下载附件\n\n2019-1-20 17:10 上传\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfile_1547975428000.jpg (479.53 KB, 下载次数: 2)\n\n下载附件\n\n2019-1-20 17:10 上传\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n【怎么使用OTG】\n\nMod版有dalao已经搬运过了，以下是链接。我就不多说了。这次着重教大家怎么安装OTG的插件。1.你可以选择看这个视频（youtube）官方原版OTG插件安装教程(请自备梯子）2.按照以下方法安装1.下载OTG本体以及地图包2.解压地图包。3.将OTG本体丢进插件plugins文件重启并关闭服务器4.依次打开地图包中的assets--worldpacker文件夹，并且将worldpacker文件夹内的文件夹复制出来（名字一般是你地图包的名字）然后就可以删除地图包里面的剩下的文件了5.将你之前拿出来的地图包文件放进plugins中的OpenTerrainGenerator中的worlds里面，启动服务器6.将文件夹改成你打算创建的世界的名称（纯英文）7.启动服务器，打开你的多世界插件 输入指令 生成世界\n\n[MV]：/mv create  <世界名>  normal -g OpenTerrainGenerator[MV]：暂不知道\n 备注：生成地图耗能较大，请做好崩服的准备【相关指令】/otg  显示帮助/otg worldinfo 显示此世界的信息/otg biome (-f, -s, -d, -m) 在玩家坐标处显示生物群系的生物群系信息/otg map <world name>  在指定的服务器根目录下生成生物群系图和温度图/otg reload 重载插件（命令还有很多，其余的我都看不懂。所以没加上，如果有dalao知道的话回复下，我会加上去的）\n【设置世界内容】\n打开安装过程（4）中拿到的文件夹，打开里面的WorldConfig.ini文件在其中可以编辑世界包的基础配置内容这里是原文对世界包配置文件的说明和介绍\nGenerator Modes EditOTG can function in several different 'modes', such as deciding between 'random' and 'from image' biome generation, some debugging and testing modes and others.\nTerrain Modes EditNormal - Use all features (the standard option)TerrainTest - Generate only terrain without any resources (trees, ores, etc)NotGenerate - Generate empty chunksDefault - Use default Minecraft world type / terrain generator (not fully working)OldGenerator - Minecraft Beta 1.7.3-like land generatorBiome Modes EditNormal - Use all featuresFromImage - Get biomes from image fileDefault - use default Minecraft biome generator (for use with Default Terrain Mode)BeforeGroups - Minecraft 1.0 - 1.6.4 biome generator, (only supports the biome groups NormalBiomes and IceBiomes)OldGenerator - Minecraft Beta 1.7.3 biome generatorCustom Biome ID Registration EditYou need to register your custom biomes here. This setting will make Terrain Control generate and read the setting files for them. However, it won't place them in the world automatically. See the settings for your BiomeMode below on how to add them to the world.\nSyntax: CustomBiomes:BiomeName:id[,AnotherBiomeName:id[,...]]\nExample:\nCustomBiomes:DesertMountains:80,DesertOasis:71This will add two biomes and generate the BiomeConfigs for them. All changes here need a server restart.\nDue to the way Mojang's loading code works, all biome ids need to be unique on the server. If you don't do this, the client will display the biomes just fine, but the server can think it is another biome with the same id. This will cause saplings, snowfall and mobs to work as in the other biome.\nThe available ids range from 0 to 1023, inclusive. Minecraft uses IDs between the ranges of 0-39 and 129-167. Using those IDs is not possible.\nIDs above 255 can not be saved to the map due to Minecraft's biome ID limit. You will need to add a ReplaceToBiomeName setting to those biomes to make sure that they are saved to the world files using an id below 256.\nSettings for Random Generation (BiomeMode:Normal) EditThe values in this section only work when BiomeMode is set to Normal or BiomeMode is FromImage and ImageMode is ContinueNormal\nGenerationDepth EditValue for deciding biome size limits. Bigger values 'zoom in', so that the biomes get larger:\nAll size settings such as Biome Group Size, RiverSize, LandSize (in the WorldConfig.ini), and BiomeSize (in Biome Configs) must be between 0 (largest) and GenerationDepth (smallest).\nFor a full explanation of Generation Depth, go here: GenerationDepth\nBiomeRarityScale EditMax biome rarity from 1 to infinity. By default this is 100, but you can raise it for fine-grained control, or to create biomes with a chance of occurring smaller than 1/100.\nBiomeGroups EditThis allows you to group similar biomes together so that they spawn next to each other.\nNote: If you're using BiomeMode: BeforeGroups, only the biomes listed in groups named NormalBiomes and IceBiomes and the size and rarity of the group named IceBiomes will be used. Other groups are ignored. The size and rarity of the NormalBiomes group is ignored as well, use LandSize and LandRarity instead.\nSyntax: BiomeGroup(Name, Size, Rarity, BiomeName[, AnotherName[, ...]])\nName - It is wise to choose something descriptiveSize - From 0 to GenerationDepth, all biomes in the group must have a BiomeSize higher than or equal to this valueRarity - relative spawn chanceBiomeName - Names of the biome that spawn in the group, case sensitiveExample:\nBiomeGroup(NormalBiomes, 0, 98, Forest, Roofed Forest, Extreme Hills, Plains, Birch Forest, Swampland, Flower Forest, Roofed Forest M, Extreme Hills+, Sunflower Plains, Birch Forest M, Swampland M)BiomeGroup(IceBiomes, 2, 40, Ice Plains, Cold Taiga, Ice Plains Spikes, Cold Taiga M)BiomeGroup(HotBiomes, 1, 98, Desert, Savanna, Plains, Desert M, Savanna M, Sunflower Plains)BiomeGroup(ColdBiomes, 0, 98, Forest, Extreme Hills, Taiga, Plains, Flower Forest, Extreme Hills+, Taiga M, Sunflower Plains)BiomeGroup(MesaBiomes, 2, 40, Mesa)BiomeGroup(JungleBiomes, 1, 40, Jungle, Jungle M)BiomeGroup(Mega TaigaBiomes, 1, 40, Mega Taiga, Mega Spruce Taiga)Biome Lists EditNot all biomes spawn as part of a group. Some biomes spawn as isles in other biomes, or as borders on other biomes.\nIsle Biomes EditIsleBiomes: Deep Ocean, MushroomIsland, Ice Mountains, DesertHills, ForestHills, Forest, TaigaHills, JungleHills, Cold Taiga Hills, Birch Forest Hills, Extreme Hills+, Mesa Plateau, Mesa Plateau F, Mesa Plateau M, Mesa Plateau F M, Mesa (Bryce), Mega Taiga Hills, Mega Spruce Taiga HillsIsle biomes are biomes which spawn inside another biome. Biome name is case sensitive. Inside the biome config of each isle biome you can decide in which biome this isle should spawn, it's rarity and size\nNote: Isle biomes' sizes must be smaller (higher BiomeSize number) than the biome they are inside.\nBorder Biomes EditBorder biomes are biomes which are used as borders. In the biome config of the biome you can specify on which biome this border should spawn. You can also set which biome this border should not spawn near. Biome name is case sensitive.\nLandmass Settings EditLandRarity EditLand rarity from 1 to 100. Higher numbers result in more land:\nLandSize EditLand size from 0 to GenerationDepth. Higher LandSize numbers will make the size of the land smaller.\nLandFuzzy EditGenerates more lakes (via small ocean biomes) at the edges of continents. As a side effect, the continent will also get a bit larger. Must be from 0 to GenerationDepth minus LandSize. Map of the edge of a continent:\nIce Area Settings EditFrozenOcean EditCan be true or false, makes the water of the oceans near a cold biome frozen. The definition of 'cold' is controlled by the next setting.\nOceanFreezingTemperature EditThis is the maximum biome temperature when a biome is still considered cold. Water in oceans nearby cold biomes freezes if FrozenOcean is set to true. Temperature reference from vanilla Minecraft: < 0.15 for snow, 0.15 - 0.95 for rain, or > 1.0 for dry\nFreezeAllBiomesInColdGroup EditIf the average of all biome temperatures in a biome group is less than \"OceanFreezingTemperature\", when this setting is true, all biomes in the group will have frozen oceans. When this setting is false, only individual biomes with a temperature below \"OceanFreezingTemperature\" will have frozen oceans.\nRiver Settings EditRiverRarity EditControls the rarity of rivers. Must be from 0 to GenerationDepth. A higher number means more rivers, to define which rivers flow through which biomes see the individual biome configs.\nRiverSize EditControls the size of rivers. Can range from 0 to GenerationDepth minus RiverRarity. Making this larger will make the rivers larger, without affecting how much rivers will spawn.\nRandomRivers EditWhen this setting is false rivers follow the biome borders most of the time. Set this setting to true to disable this behaviour.\nImprovedRivers EditNormally rivers use technical biomes (defined in each biome config) to generate. With the default settings the biomes River and FrozenRiver are used. If you set this setting to true, the technical biomes won't be used anymore in the world. This causes the rivers to look exactly like the biome they are flowing through: no more sudden changes of grass color. The height settings of the river can now be found in the biome the river is flowing through.\nSettings for generating a biome distribution from an image (BiomeMode:FromImage) EditThe values in this section only work when BiomeMode is set to FromImage.\nImageMode EditDefines what to do when terrain is generated outside the boundaries of the image:\nRepeatRepeats the imageMirrorMirrors the imageContinueNormalContinues with random generationFillEmptyFills the space with one biome (defined below)ImageFile EditThe image which will provide the Biomes must be a PNG file without transparency, once placed in the same folder as WorldConfig.ini OTG will use it as a reference for the Biomes generation. Usually the map spawn location is considered to be the center of the image (but you can change this behaviour with the ImageXOffset/ImageYOffset settings.\nThe map must be drawn with a pixel perfect brush (means without AntiAliasing) often called as the Pencil tool in many image editors. Each color (expressed as an hexadecimal value) represent a Biome where the Biome<->Color association is made in each biome configuration file Biome.cfg, a map can be as simple as few colors or articulated and complex as ** shown below.\nFrom a biome.cfg configurartion file you can set the color associated with the map with the following option:# The hexadecimal color value of this biome. Used in the output of the /otg map command,# and used in the input of BiomeMode: FromImage.BiomeColor: #D76969When drawing your map keep in mind the size you want your map to be and that each pixel is mapped as a surface of 4x4 blocks. Based on your OTG settings the transition from biome to biome can be more or less smooth. You can also set what biome should spawn in the unlikely case you forgot to draw an area or used a color not associated to any biome.\nCloseup of the Map file\nExample Biome map courtesy of the Dregora OTG presets (MIT).\nImageOrientation EditHow the image is oriented: North, South, East or West. When this is set to North, the image is placed in the world in the normal way. When it is set to East, the image is rotated 90 degrees counter-clockwise in memory so, that what is on the east in the image becomes north in the world.\nImageFillBiome EditWhen using the FillEmpty mode this biome will be used when generating outside the image.\nImageXOffset/ImageYOffset EditTranslates the map origin. For some reason, this number needs to be multiplied with -1 when using FillEmpty\nTerrain Height and Volatility EditWorldHeightScaleBits EditThe height scale of the world. Increasing this by one doubles the terrain height of the world, substracting one halves the terrain height. Values must be between 5 and 8, inclusive.\nWorldHeightCapBits EditThe height cap of the world. A cap of 7 will make sure that there is no terrain above y=2^7=128. Near this cap less and less terrain generates with no terrain above this cap. Values must be between 5 and 8, inclusive. Values may not be lower that WorldHeightScaleBits.\nFractureHorizontal EditCan increase (values greater than 0) or decrease (values less than 0) how much the landscape is fractured horizontally (see below for visual example).\nFractureVertical EditCan increase (values greater than 0) or decrease (values less than 0) how much the landscape is fractured vertically. Positive values will lead to large cliffs/overhangs, floating islands, and/or a cavern world depending on other settings. A comparisation of different FractureHorizontal and FractureVertical values:\nExample of dimensions features in use\nDimensions:The name(s) of any other world presets that you want to have enabled/initialized alongside this world. Dimensions above/below must be listed here (see options below).DimensionBelow:The name of another world preset that is 'below' this world.DimensionAbove:The name of another world preset that is 'above' this world.DimensionPortalMaterials:The block ID or cartographer (experimental)Game rules (dimensions only)\nGame rules for dimensions (these do not work for the overworld at the moment). These settings are still in development and may be subject to change in upcoming releases.\nCommandBlockOutput:Whether command blocks should notify admins when they perform commands.DisableElytraMovementCheck:Whether the server should skip checking player speed when the player is wearing elytra. Often helps with jittering due to lag in multiplayer, but may also be used to travel unfairly long distances in survival mode (cheating).DoDaylightCycle:Whether the day-night cycle and moon phases progress.DoEntityDrops:Whether entities that are not mobs should have drops.DoFireTick:Whether fire should spread and naturally extinguish.DoMobLoot:Whether mobs should drop items.DoMobSpawning:Whether mobs should naturally spawn. Does not affect monster spawners.DoTileDrops:Whether blocks should have drops.DoWeatherCycle:Whether the weather will change.KeepInventory:Whether the player should keep items in their inventory after death.LogAdminCommands:Whether to log admin commands to server log.MaxEntityCramming:The maximum number of other pushable entities a mob or player can push, before taking 3 doublehearts suffocation damage per half-second. Setting to 0 disables the rule. Damage affects survival-mode or adventure-mode players, and all mobs but bats. Pushable entities include non-spectator-mode players, any mob except bats, as well as boats and minecarts.MobGriefing:Whether creepers, zombies, endermen, ghasts, withers, ender dragons, rabbits, sheep, and villagers should be able to change blocks and whether villagers, zombies, skeletons, and zombie pigmen can pick up items.NaturalRegeneration:Whether the player can regenerate health naturally if their hunger is full enough (doesn't affect external healing, such as golden apples, the Regeneration effect, etc).RandomTickSpeed:How often a random block tick occurs (such as plant growth, leaf decay, etc.) per chunk section per game tick. 0 will disable random ticks, higher numbers will increase random ticks.ReducedDebugInfo:Whether the debug screen shows all or reduced information; and whether the effects of F3+B (entity hitboxes) and F3+G (chunk boundaries) are shown.SendCommandFeedback:Whether the feedback from commands executed by a player should show up in chat. Also affects the default behavior of whether command blocks store their output text.ShowDeathMessages:Whether death messages are put into chat when a player dies. Also affects whether a message is sent to the pet's owner when the pet dies.SpawnRadius:The number of blocks outward from the world spawn coordinates that a player will spawn in when first joining a server or when dying without a spawnpoint.SpectatorsGenerateChunks:Whether players in spectator mode can generate chunks.World provider settings (dimensions only)\nWorld provider settings for dimensions (these do not work for the overworld at the moment). These settings are still in development and may be subject to change in upcoming releases.\nWelcomeMessage:A message to display to the user when they transfer to this dimension. (Currently broken OTG 1.10.2 v21 / 1.11.2 v6)DepartMessage:A Message to display to the user when they transfer out of this dimension. (Currently broken OTG 1.10.2 v21 / 1.11.2 v6)HasSkyLight:A boolean that tells if a world has a sky or not. Used for calculating weather and skylight. Also affects GetActualHeight(), hasSkyLight = false worlds are seen as 128 height worlds, which affects nether portal placement/detection.IsSurfaceWorld:Returns 'true' if in the \"main surface world\", but 'false' if in the Nether or End dimensions. Affects: Clock, Compass, sky/cloud rendering, allowed to sleep here, zombie pigmen spawning in portal frames.CanRespawnHere:True if the player can respawn in this dimension (true = overworld, false = nether).DoesWaterVaporize:True for nether, any water that is placed vaporises.DoesXZShowFog:Returns true if the given X,Z coordinate should show environmental fog. True for Nether.UseCustomFogColor:Set this to true if you want to use the fog color settings below.FogColorRed:FogColorGreen:FogColorBlue:IsSkyColored:Is set to false for End (black sky?)CloudHeight:CanDoLightning:CanDoRainSnowIce:IsNightWorld:If true then the sky will be locked at midnight with the moon and stars above but the world will be lit as if it were day time. Useful for space dimensions.VoidFogYFactor:A double value representing the Y value relative to the top of the map at which void fog is at its maximum. The default factor of 0.03125 relative to 256, for example, means the void fog will be at its maximum at (256*0.03125), or 8.ShouldMapSpin:Determine if the cursor on the map should 'spin' when rendered, like it does for the player in the nether.CanDropChunk:Called to determine if the chunk at the given chunk coordinates within the provider's world can be dropped. Used in WorldProviderSurface to prevent spawn chunks from being unloaded.\n我这里准备了一份预制世界的配置文件WorldConfig.ini文件的简单汉化版，英文水平有限。但是大部分功能都已经进行了翻译注释\n\n\n\n\n\nWorldConfig.zip\n(6.5 KB, 下载次数: 375)\n\n\n\n2019-1-20 17:05 上传\n点击文件名下载附件\n\n\n\n\n\n\n【如何编辑世界】本人的英文水平实在太渣，编辑世界那部分是在啃不下来。好歹算是搞定了基础的东西。如果论坛有dalao愿意帮助编辑我会继续修改的。\n【下载地址】官方下载合集：本体+附属\n\n\n\n\n【传说空岛】OTG-Skylands-1.12.2-v5.jar\n(191.19 KB, 下载次数: 172)\n\n\n\n2019-1-20 17:07 上传\n点击文件名下载附件\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n【传说地形】OpenTerrainGenerator-1.12.2+-+v6.jar\n(1.09 MB, 下载次数: 536)\n\n\n\n2019-1-20 17:07 上传\n点击文件名下载附件\n\n\n\n\n\n预制地形也想上传上来的结果太大了发不上来预制地形官方下载地点\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
