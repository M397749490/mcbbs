This includes registry dumps of all the things that the vanilla game (or Forge) have registries for.\nIt also has commands for:\n1) listing loaded chunks, dimensions, entities or block entities either by type, by chunk, or listing them all\n2) locating blocks, entities or block entities by name\n3) listing some information about and the NBT data of the item in the player's hand, or the block the player is looking at\n4) counting block or biome statistics/distribution in a given area, or sampling biomes on a grid trying to search for the closest occurences of each biome\n\nCurseForge page with a bit more information:\nhttps://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/tellme"
