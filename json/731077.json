But to simplify the setup there is a setting in the advacnedban config called \"EnableAllPermissionNodes\" which allows you to use a .all instead of a .* so if enabled a user with ab.all will have access to all AdvancedBan commands. (There is another explanation in the config)\n\n网址：https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/advancedban.8695/\n群组怎么才有权限，不用数据库",
