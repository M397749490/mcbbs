If they still don't start work after a couple minutes, and If there is water near the village try filling it up to provide space do not just cover it. Also Try adding 10-15 to the village radius in the \"config.txt\" in your millenaire folder every time it says \"not enough space\". If that didn't work, you should open the corresponding building plan in the \"building plans\" folder and lower the minDistance parameter. \n\n\nWhen NPC can't find a location to put a building \"Not enough space\" You can move the location of where they want to build to somewhere with room. I have noticed I have a lot of room around my towns but they have done that."
