Who I am and where I'm from does not matter. I shall be long gone when you read this.\n\nIt all started the day when young Perrson walked up to me and John. He was a new player, and didn't know the basics of minecraft. So I taught him how to craft, mine, and build. He was a fast learning student. But then the tragic day came.....\n\n\nPart 2: The Lesson\nYoung Perrson was mining, then thought to himself, what if I dig straight down. Nobody knew not to do it, so Perrson did it, Then he fell straight into lava. Me and John could hear his shrieks from above the ground. Everyone mourned and learned from/for Perrson.\n",
