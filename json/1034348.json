Yet, I was determined to go ahead.\nI remember back to my 7th year in school. In my first P.E. class, the teacher required us to run laps and then hit a softball. I didn’t do either well. He later informed me that I was ＂not athletic＂.\nThe idea that I was ＂not athletic＂ stuck with me for years. When I started running in my 30s, I realized running was a battle against myself, not about competition or whether or not I was athletic. It was all about the battle against my own body and mind. A test of wills!\nThe night before my marathon, I dreamt that I couldn’t even find the finish line. I woke up sweating and nervous, but ready to prove something to myself.\nShortly after crossing the start line, my shoe laces(鞋带) became untied. So I stopped to readjust. Not the start I wanted!\nAt mile 3, I passed a sign: ＂GO FOR IT, RUNNERS!＂\nBy mile 17, I became out of breath and the once injured ankle hurt badly. Despite the pain, I stayed the course walking a bit and then running again.\nBy mile 21, I was starving!\nAs I approached mile 23, I could see my wife waving a sign. She is my biggest fan. She never minded the alarm clock sounding at 4 a.m. or questioned my expenses on running.\nI was one of the final runners to finish. But I finished! And I got a medal. In fact, I got the same medal as the空one that the guy who came in first place had.\nDetermined to be myself, move forward, free of shame and worldly labels(世俗标签), I can now call myself a ＂marathon winner＂.\n1.A month before the marathon, the author ____________.A. lost hope    B. made up his mind to runC. felt scared    D. was well trained\n2.Why did the author mention the P.E. class in his 7th year?A.

He walked to the end.    B. He got the first prize.C. He quit halfway.    D. He made it.\n4.What does the story mainly tell us?A. A winner is one with a great effort of will.B. Failure is the mother of success.C. One is never too old to learn.D. A man owes his success to his family support.",
