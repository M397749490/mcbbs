Above you can see the example of how it's done. You need to create a custom category, using # chars, then write the code effect name(make sure your name is unique, otherwise your effect will most likely be ignored).\n#  Then you need to write this name again, this time without # chars, and add {} after it.\n#  Now, there are 3 fields you need to write in this {}.\n#  The first one is 'name'. This says, what name will be actually shown in-game(the tool prefix).\n#  Second one is 'color'. You should put one hex number there. You can choose from this number set: 8,f,a,2,9,d,e,6,b,3,c,4. These represent the rarity of your effect. You can learn more about rarities in DummyCore code, in EnumRarityColor file.\n#  The last one is 'dataArray'. This represents the effects, that will be applied to your buff. There are 5 effects by now - 'damage','speed','invulTime','durability' and 'crit'.\n#  To write this data you need to follow the simple rules: after : put ||, then put an actual name of one of the 5 possible effects. Then put : again, and after that write your value. It can be below 0, and it is always not an integer. This value is persentage-based, and it scales, as 1 = 100%, and 0.25 = 25%\n#  If you want to add more than one effect, ust put || after the value you have last written, and start writing another data string. But remember, that || represents the beginning of the new datastring, so something like |||| will most likely lead to crash.\n##########################################################################################################\n\nHelp {\n}",
