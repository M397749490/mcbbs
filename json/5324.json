    "txt_content": " 本帖最后由 maxsunma 于 2011-6-1 12:15 编辑 \n\n好吧，我有一个好消息和一个坏消息要告诉大家：好消息是：Hippoplatimus正在努力地更新活塞MOD中；\n坏消息是：他似乎碰上麻烦了，活塞MOD目前有重大问题无法发表……\n\n以下是Hippoplatimus的原话：\n\nOK... ugh...\n\nI can't figure out how to get MCP to work. I've used it before, but... eh...\n\nrun_client works fine, and the mod works, and the new features work, and there are no bugs, etc. I run reobfuscate, that works, install pistons in normal Minecraft. Here's where it gets weird.\n\nI go into a world that has pistons in it already, and they render fine, so obviously the mod is loading correctly. I can destroy the pistons and they show up in my inventory. However, when I place a piston or power an existing one the game crashes. No error report appears on the screen, or anywhere else I can find.\n\nIt seems likely that something weird has happened (like MCP isn't obfuscating certain files properly). Has anyone else had problems with MCP 4.0? Is there something dumb going on?\n\nI can't update pistons until this is fixed.\n\n\n\n大意是：已经能成功进入原本有活塞存在的世界，并且能看到活塞了，说明MOD已经成功加载了。活塞可以成功破坏并放入物品栏，这个也没问题。但是最关键的是，一旦放置新的活塞或者给活塞通电，程序都会崩溃并且没有错误信息……（这不是完全不能用么）。作者已经被MCP搞疯了，不把这个问题解决了，活塞MOD1.6也没戏了……\n",
