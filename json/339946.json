I make games because it’s fun, and because I love games and I love to program, but I don’t make games with the intention of them becoming huge hits, and I don’t try to change the world. Minecraft certainly became a huge hit, and people are telling me it’s changed games. I never meant for it to do either. It’s certainly flattering, and to gradually get thrust into some kind of public spotlight is interesting.\n我认为我并不是一个游戏开发者。我开发游戏纯粹是因为好玩，我喜欢游戏，也喜欢编程，但是我从来没有为了搞个大新闻去写游戏，我也没想过要改变世界。Minecraft确实成了个大新闻，人们也跟我说它改变了有细节。我根本没希望其中的任何一件事情发生。这些只是奉承，不过逐渐被大众所关注也是一件蛮有意思的事情。\n\nA relatively long time ago, I decided to step down from Minecraft development. Jens was the perfect person to take over leading it, and I wanted to try to do new things. At first, I failed by trying to make something big again, but since I decided to just stick to small prototypes and interesting challenges, I’ve had so much fun with work. I wasn’t exactly sure how I fit into Mojang where people did actual work, but since people said I was important for the culture, I stayed.\n在之前，我决定离开Minecraft的开发的领头者的位置。Jebs（译：原文的Jens应该是错字）是接手的最佳人选，而我想去做点别的。最开始，我因为又尝试搞大项目而失败了一次（译：大概指的0x10c）。之后我决定关注小项目，关注好玩的挑战。我在这些工作中寻找到了许多乐趣。我甚至不确定我怎么能在Mojang呆下去的，因为公司的员工都是干实事的，但是人们都说我对这个文化环境非常重要，所以我留下来了。\n\nI was at home with a bad cold a couple of weeks ago when the internet exploded with hate against me over some kind of EULA situation that I had nothing to do with. I was confused. I didn’t understand. I tweeted this in frustration. Later on, I watched the This is Phil Fish video on YouTube and started to realize I didn’t have the connection to my fans I thought I had. I’ve become a symbol. I don’t want to be a symbol, responsible for something huge that I don’t understand, that I don’t want to work on, that keeps coming back to me. I’m not an entrepreneur. I’m not a CEO. I’m a nerdy computer programmer who likes to have opinions on Twitter.\n之前互联网上因为EULA之类的炸开锅的时候我正患着重感冒躺在家里。我跟EULA一点关系都没，我很困惑，我不理解，于是我发了条推问。之后，我看了YouTube上Phil Fish的视频，才明白我并没有与我的粉丝们建立起我想象中的任何联系。我成了一个符号。我不想成为符号，不想承担一件大得我无法理解的事情的责任，不想继续在一件不断地骚扰我的事情上继续工作下去。我不是企业家，也不是CEO，我只是个喜欢发Twitter表达观点的逗逼程序猿。\n\nAs soon as this deal is finalized, I will leave Mojang and go back to doing Ludum Dares and small web experiments. If I ever accidentally make something that seems to gain traction, I’ll probably abandon it immediately.\n一旦收购完成，我就将离开Mojang，回去参加Ludum Dare竞赛（译：一个小游戏设计竞赛）和一些小型的互联网实验。如果我不小心又聚焦了公众的目光，我很可能会立刻弃坑。\n\nConsidering the public image of me already is a bit skewed, I don’t expect to get away from negative comments by doing this, but at least now I won’t feel a responsibility to read them.\n考虑到公众对我的态度已经有偏见了，我并不指望在这件事上能躲开负面的评价，但是至少现在，读这些评价并不会使我感到有任何的责任感。\n\nI’m aware this goes against a lot of what I’ve said in public. I have no good response to that. I’m also aware a lot of you were using me as a symbol of some perceived struggle. I’m not. I’m a person, and I’m right there struggling with you.\n我很清楚这和我在公开场合谈的一些事情有出入。我对这些没有好的回应。我也很清楚你们很多人都将我认为是坚持不妥协的象征，然而我并不是。我是一个人，我也和你们一样在奋斗。\n\nI love you. All of you. Thank you for turning Minecraft into what it has become, but there are too many of you, and I can’t be responsible for something this big. In one sense, it belongs to Microsoft now. In a much bigger sense, it’s belonged to all of you for a long time, and that will never change.\n我爱你们。感谢你们使Minecraft成为它现在这样子，但是你们人太多了，我无法承担这么大的责任。现在，它属于微软。但是长远来看，它一直都属于你们，这将永不改变。\n\nIt’s not about the money. It’s about my sanity.\n这不是为了钱，是为了我的精神正常。"
