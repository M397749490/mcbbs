Earlier this week we reported on XBL Minecraft clone Fortresscraft, and then Terraria came to our attention.\n\nWe reached out to Andrew Spinks, the game's creator and programmer, to ask whether Minecraft was an inspiration at all. \"Notch succeeded in making a very unique game that has been enjoyed by millions of people,\" said Spinks. \"I hope to be able to do the same someday.\"\n\nSpinks has done all of the game's coding himself, though he said he's also had assistance from a team of around 20 testers for some of the design decisions and a few of the graphics. He's been working on the game since January, and although there isn't an official release date yet, he told us, \"We have been approached by a large distribution network, which might speed up the game's release.\"\n\n",
