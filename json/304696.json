includes Horses, Wolves and Cats/Ocelots Reduced rate of fire from the Jabba when it was angered, also reduced the damage of it's explosion Reduced health of Minotaur from 60 to 42 Increased duration that Nor-Vox is stunned when hit while shooting wither skulls, slight reduction of health from 60 to 50 Inkling will now become visible for a small amount of time when hit and when it attacks, removed it's ability to summon other Inklings (it was being buggy) Increased Pumpkinhead's movement speed a little bit Ragr's health was reduced from 100 to 65, it's jump height when angered was increased some, it also now crushes certain blocks when it lands on them rather than when it walks over them Reduced TragicNeko's health from 125 to 80 Reduced hurt resistant time of Gragul and Kragul (the time they are immune to damage after being hurt) Changed damage type of Cryse's reflection damage Removed some console spam from a few things (I'll go through and completely remove these eventually) Reduced Inkling's damage (it didn't do much to begin with but it's main strength is attacking you while invisible, since this is confusing, especially early game I decided to reduce the damage from it) Pets are removed until a later date, their ai and overall mechanics take a lot to implement and I have too much to focus on right now so they will be shelved (they are not going to be in any future releases for a while) Increased damage that the Minotaur and Apis take from non-projectile attacks Reduced rate in which the Minotaur charges at targets Made it so that Mega Cryse now damages players that touch them in addition to it's normal attack and it's reflection ability Attempted to make it that Mini-Bosses do not target any mobs in their lineage Cryse and Mega Cryse's attack damages were reduced, Mega Cryse's reflection damage was increased Magic damage ignores Mega Cryse's shields Mega Cryse now has it's own model, changed it's hitbox to reflect this, added textures for other mobs that were missing them Minotaur and Ragr were added to dungeon spawners, Minotaur is less common then the regular mobs and Ragr is rare Increased Cryse and Mega Cryse's health a bit Adjusted bounding boxes of most of the mobs to fit them better (hitboxes better represent the model) Removed Tragic Neko from overworld, it now spawns in the dimension only The Plague now generates in the dimension in all biomes as well  Bosses: Reduced health of Apis from 200 to 160 Reduced health of Death Reaper from 250 to 220 Changed Kitsune to spam fireballs more reliably after being hurt, also fixed where it was spawning the fireballs (it was spawning them above it's head) Added a new boss, Polaris, it has medium health but will appear invisible when near the player, sometimes when angered it may go into a frenzy spamming fireballs at it's target, when this happens it must be hit to stop it, being stunned if hit by an arrow, it has extra armor at night and does slightly more damage, it also regenerates health at night Added another boss, Yeti, it reuses the previous version's model, it will remain stationary throwing rocks at it's target while also spawning in Abominations to help it (haven't yet added the Abominations or the large rocks), but when hurt enough will charge at the player aggressively until it calms down Added Time Controller, it shifts between time phases, in present mode it takes normal damage and will attack normally, however it attemps to pull players towards it, it'll also damage the player if near them, in past mode, it moves slowly but takes little damage, it will also deflect some damage that is inflicted on it and well as randomly create time disruptions around itself, in future mode, it gains armor and teleports rapidly, it regenerates faster in future mode but takes extra damage from magic Time Controller will be able to be summoned using a Time Disruption Cube, when placed on top of a + shape of iron blocks (like how you summon an iron golem except two extra iron blocks to form the + rather than just a T), the block itself will randomly shift the time of day when powered by redstone, once a tick (the Time disruptions it creates will render invisible, this is because I didn't create a model/texture for it yet) Increased chance of Time Controller to reflect damage in past mode  Amulets: Fixed issue with amulet inventory not being saved properly after quitting a world Fixed issue with amulet slots not being \"locked\" when the player does not have them unlocked Fixed issue with shift-clicking amulets that would allow you to bypass whether a slot was locked Improved checks for if an amulet is in a valid slot for use Fixed bug with Sunken amulet having the wrong information when looking at it's additional information Amulets will now only display the effect name without \"Effect:\" prefixing them Fixed new issue with amulet inventory not allowing the player to do anything in the amulet inventory, this was due to the update to new netcode Lowered base damage of amulet to 300 from 500, added ability to level up amulets through crafting Added the Time amulet, it should pull items towards you (it is a bit glitchy currently), it is an epic amulet and as such never loses durability (it will show as cursed)  Doomsdays and Doom: Reduced cooldown/cost of most of the Doomsdays (They weren't very useful if you had to wait a long time to use them) Rewrote almost the entire Doomsday class, each Doomsday now can be called from a few different methods This brings functionality to the Doomsday command (/doomsday) that allows the player to use a doomsday whenever, either through the doomsday name or the doomsday id Syntax for this command is /doomsday   and it will be used regardless of current Doom or cooldown, and will be used to it's full effectiveness if it is a multi-stage or multi-round doomsday Fixed some issues with Doomsdays, some Doomsdays were converted to other Doomsday types to allow more variety in them There is still an issue with a few of the multi-stage/multi-wave doomsdays causing a game crash, I'm still looking in to ways to reduce the chance of this or fix it completely Added new doomsday, Miner Skills, for the new tool, the Tungsten Jack, it works as an all-in-one tool but is almost completely useless in combat, the Doomsday will mine random blocks around the user (only certain blocks like dirt, grass, stone, sand, etc.) In order to give Doom more use than for Doomsdays, some weapon abilities were converted to use Doom and some were added to use it, these abilities maintain their own cooldown and do not affect overall doomsday cooldown Blinding Light's deflect projectile ability now costs 5 doom per deflection, otherwise it doesn't deflect projectiles Enigma Shield's negate unblockable damage ability now costs 10 doom per negation, otherwise it doesn't negate the damage Added a fireball (small and large) to the Reaper Scythe, sneak and right-click for a large fireball (15 doom cost) and right-click without sneaking for a small fireball (5 doom cost) Added a Wither Skull (blue and normal) to the Withering Axe, sneak and right-click for a Blue Wither Skull (25 doom cost) and right-click without sneaking for a regular Wither Skull (15 doom cost) Converted Neko Launcher to use Doom per rocket fired, it only costs 5 Doom per use Gravity Spike will now randomly launch enemies away from you that you hit normally, it costs 8 doom to use Guilty Thorn's poison/stun ability now requires 10 doom to use Blinding Light can now fire a Solar Bomb when right-clicked without sneaking, it costs 15 doom, it's ability to burn targets you hit normally now costs 7 doom Added an explosion ability to the Mourning star when right-clicked without sneaking (25 doom cost) that creates an explosion on you (doesn't damage you) and when you right-click while shifting creates an explosion at where you are looking at (30 doom cost) Fixed some small bugs with Nature Drain, also improved it's healing effectiveness slightly Improved some things with the Multi-stage doomsdays that will hopefully stop the game crash that would occur with them sometimes Improved effectiveness of Miner Skills doomsday  Structures: Added Obsidian Cavern structures, these structures generate with a random opening on the surface and go all the way down to bedrock, the cavern will generate with random bosses or mobs and with random loot, generally more loot for more difficult cavern generation The structure seed will have specific combinations to be generated, but when they generate naturally they will be randomized Obsidian Caverns now only generate in the dimension Added a Kitsune Den, it will generate in the Dimension as well as in the Nether, it will have 1 kitsune spawner but will spawn with up to 4 smaller dens containing jabbas, there will be a chest for each one that is summoned, it generates in random elevations like dungeons The Obsidian Caverns will now generate only in the Tragic Dimension Improved overall efficiency of structure generation, reduced overall chance for structures to generate Next version should contain the Polaris and Time Controller structures  Dimension: Added the Tragic Dimension, it has a configurable id (and provider id) and is also able to be toggled off if you do not wish to use it although some things may be unavailable to you if you do so It contains multiple custom biomes and contains vanilla ores (emerald, diamond, iron, gold, coal, lapis) as well as this mod's ores (ruby, sapphire, tungsten, red mercury) as well as an xp ore that gives tons of xp when mined, the ore generation has the uncommon ores typically generate below y = 64 and above y = 160 Some structures only generate in the dimension, and some mobs will only spawn in the dimension's biomes In the Decaying biomes, void pits generate at random heights (these are large vertical openings that go down to the void), they also have a lot of bone spikes and are inhabited by a large number of bats In the Painted biomes, lots of vegetation grows, including new types like glowvines, and new types of trees When you teleport to the dimension, if it picks a spot that is not safe, it should generate a platform for you, still may randomly spawn you underground though for some reason The dimension uses \"layered\" stone generation, meaning that it generates dark stone as normal but then generates a variant of it at specific y levels based on seed The dimension is currently extremely laggy if you do not have a really good computer (and still will have some framerate drops), this will be worked on for the next release  Blocks and Items: Renamed main and special tabs to Survival and Creative respectively Moved some blocks to Survival tab Removed Killswitch and Tormentor, changed Magnetar to pull items towards it, while the Pulsar pushes mobs and animals away Changed Magnetar/Pulsar to use a cubic area rather than a rectangular area that contained the entire y-axis, removed the requirement to have to be placed by a player to be used Altered recipe for Bone Marrow to use Bone Meal instead of Bones Altered a few recipes, added a lot of recipes for weapons that previously didn't have them (derp) Added a few new items related to the new drops from the new bosses Added a few new items that utilize the Time Essence (dropped from the Time Controller), you can now craft the Celestial Aegis and Celestial Longbow with it Added two creative mode only weapons, the Bow of Justice and the Sword of Justice, they should insta-kill any mob that you attack with them Added all of the dimension-specific ore blocks Added some of the custom biome blocks, mostly variants of vanilla blocks Added more of the armor textures (not actually rendered textures yet), changed some of the other block textures Changed textures for a few of the items, Ruby, Sapphire, Tungsten, etc. Added some new blocks for the new structures Added a lot of new flower types, originally meant for my dimension they will generate in the overworld, some only generate in specific biomes, you can toggle this off in the config  Random Things: Added two new Damage Types, one is an alternative magic damage, the other is suffocation damage from the Gragul/Kragul Reduced weakness effect on respawned players and added a check to ensure the player's health is at the right amount due to the Cripple effect Reorganized the classes/packages the mod uses, this shouldn't affect the end user, but for me it reduces the amount of extraneous packages and makes things all-around easier to find Added some extra checks with the potion event changes to ensure that if it fails to add them, then they are disabled Fixed a rare issue where one of the Extra Weapon Enchantments would crash due to an rng attempting to generate from a negative value Greatly reduced chance of Divine Intervention occurring Adjusted Dynamic Health adjustment's qualifiers, more of my mobs should uphold to it and all of the bosses should now (except Kitsune) Made it so that dirt now can only drop glowstone dust when it's below y = 32 Removed Villager Trades (also removed from config) Defaulted the \"Creeper always explode\" option to false Cows now can drop horns on death Fixed a bug with one of the enchantments that caused it to crash the game when used with a high enchantment level Fixed memory leaks associated with the previous network code, this should reduce lag on servers and for client-side users This fix includes some rewrites to my netcode, overall more efficient Made it so that Immunity now prevents you from being affected by Stun To keep your config up to date, delete it and reload the game to refresh it Removed the \"magic\" aspect of the mod as it worked inefficiently and also was quite buggy, this should fix problems with ppl being unable to kill certain mobs Removed the Rune Walker and Rune Break enchantments, as well as the Hornet amulet, these may get retooled later on but for now they are removed Reduced total amount of packets being sent from server to client, should reduce some lag Added a lot of recipes that were missing or that were previously in the mod but removed somehow Added a lot of nullchecks with my metadata blocks due to some errors that were occurring with NEI Split release of the 1.7.2 and 1.7.10 versions, this will be the last 1.7.2 release\n\n\n\n1.6.4与1.7.2压缩在一起，下载之后请选择你想要的（TragicMC 1.6.4）（TragicMC2
