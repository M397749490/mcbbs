            "txt_content": "回复 4 # L.y 的帖子\n\nVoxatron is an arena shooter that takes place in a world made of voxels (little cubes, kind of). Everything in the game is displayed in a virtual 128x128x64 voxel display, including the menus and player inventory. If you look closely, you can sometimes see the inventory (score/life/ammo) casting a shadow on some of the objects on the ground.\n\nI've been working on voxel rendering and modeling tools for a long time now, with the ultimate goal of making a large explorey adventure game. About half a year ago it fused with work I was doing on arena shooters for Conflux, and this is the result.\n\nIt's quite a simple game at heart -- mostly just Robotron set in a 3d destructible world with goofy creatures. I'm unsure how major the implications of destructibility will be for gameplay, but it sure is fun to blast away pieces of wall. I've also added an experimental wall-building pickup you can use to construct barriers to hide from scary monsters.\n\nThe game takes place in a small set of arenas. Some of them feature rooms with set action pieces, somewhere between Knightlore and Smash TV. This is some of the original adventure based design sneaking back in, and an excuse to create thematic environments.\n\nFeatures:\n- Custom software rendering with soft shadows.\n- Built-in sound and music synthesizer (also used to make the trailer music).\n- Playback & post game recording.\n\nVoxatron will be ready later this year, but I'll create a single-arena preview version too.\n\n\nP#1183 Posted at 2011-01-04 14:57\ntags: voxatron preview \n\n他们bbs上的一段话。。"
