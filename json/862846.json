Fairy Lights, Fancy Lamps, Blockcraftery, Little Tiles, and Architecturecraft are just a few of the options and when paired with building aids like BetterBuilders wands and Chisel, well, the sky is the limit! The inclusion of ProjectEX providing easy access to bulk materials through EMC enhances the flow of the build centric gameplay so there's nothing stopping you from completing your Minecraft masterpiece!\n一号肝帝服务器:FTB Interactions\n原帖\n英文介绍Do you want to traverse the dark star Aurelia, scavenging its dungeons for rare technology while fighting off Eldritch Praetors? How about draining the blue vitriol oceans of Euclydes to feed the copper consumption of your increasingly large factories? Have you ever made a floating reincarnation prison for the Ender Dragon, harvesting its heart to empower your weapons and armor? Or watered your flowers with infused starlight and diesel? Do you actually want to know what happens when you submerge a Mighty Ender Chicken in magical anti-matter? The journey to answer these questions isn't going to be a short one.FTB Interactions is the largest and most ambitious progression pack FTB has developed to date. The pack was designed to encourage cross-mod interactions to solve logistical challenges, defeat buffed mobs, outright cheese traditional obstacles, and even automate the killing of bosses. It's a progression and quest driven pack that is targeted towards people looking for a long term challenge for themselves or in a server setting with teams in mind.Many large well-known mods are featured in the pack, foremost among them is Gregtech: Community Edition which serves as the backbone of the pack's progression, while mods like Thermal Expansion, Astral Sorcery, EnderIO, and Blood Magic play supporting roles. Over 20,000 lines of unique scripting was used to eliminate redundant materials or blocks (who needs 10 furnaces from 10 mods?) and integrate mod recipes and mechanics to make sure there was a polished, sensible experience when exploring how mods interact with each other. On top of that, traditional progression of mods have been flipped on their heads to encourage new playstyles or to better balance their functionality in a large pack.\n此包难度巨大，适合养佬，能玩巨长时间\n游戏截图\n\n\n\n\n\nfile_1556877832000.jpg (600.47 KB, 下载次数: 0)\n\n下载附件\n\n2019-5-3 18:04 上传\n\n\n\n\n\n二号肝帝服务器:臭氧计划3(PO3)\nProject Ozone 3 A New Way Forward\n\n\n\n\n\nfile_1556878148000.jpg (197.89 KB, 下载次数: 0)\n\n下载附件\n\n2019-5-3 18:10 上传\n\n\n\n\n\n三号肝帝服务器:天空工厂4之钻石空岛SkyFactory-4原帖英文介绍Back again for more modded skyblock fun! SkyFactory 4 offers a brand-new experience never before seen in the series. Full automation, tech, magic, and bacon resources! This iteration offers over 30+ world types so you can play the pack like never before! While some world types are based on the classic tree on dirt others are designed with unique recipes and advancements.What makes this version different from every other SkyFactory before it? We've completely redesigned the resource gathering. Sieving for resources are a thing of the past. For a more immersive experience, Sky Orchards has been introduced. Resource Trees provides a built-in progression system and lets the player choose the resources they want to produce rather than a randomized system. We've removed the achievement book and replaced it with the advancement system. Instead of requiring players to manually check out what they've accomplished, the game will keep track for you. This system isn't designed to create a required questing system, but rather an optional set of goals for players looking for ideas on what to do next.SkyFactory 4 introduces the prestige system! This is a completely optional game mode allowing you to unlock mods, items, and mechanics through an open progression system. Prestige points and unlocks are global and can be brought with you to other worlds! Prestige points can be gained by finishing advancements or by using the Parabox, a time traveling box that generates points. To get started, enable prestige mode on the world creation screen.Beyond this initial release, we are planning regular content updates outside of bug fixes. There is currently a full progression into late game. New content updates will introduce new world types, new game modes, more prestige unlocks, and more!\n\n\n\n\n\nfile_1555738851000.jpg (219.02 KB, 下载次数: 0)\n\n下载附件\n\n2019-5-3 18:14 上传\n\n\n\n\n\n服务器配置以及云存档介绍\n\n\n\n\n\n收费标准.png (55.26 KB, 下载次数: 0)\n\n下载附件\n\n2019-5-3 18:17 上传\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n123.png (103.74 KB, 下载次数: 0)\n\n下载附件\n\n2019-5-3 18:18 上传\n\n\n\n\n软件方面采用cat server PRO付费版128元每月力争为玩家带来舒服的游戏体验联系方式QQ群:839268907点我加群服主QQ:1530043661\n\n",
