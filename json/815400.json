            "txt_content": "标题: 风暴王国 | Kingdom of Galekin - 1.5 本帖最后由 夜刀神十香 于 2018-8-18 13:24 编辑 \n\n\n风暴王国 | Kingdom of Galekin\n [ 地图简介 | Map Info ]\n该创作地图名称为“Kingdom of Galekin”，是玩家Linard独自一人用了5年半打造而成\n是一个带有中古世纪风格的奇幻国度。\n\n作者也从没有停止对“Kingdom of Galekin”的更新，到目前为止作者已经更新了多个版本\n地图也在不断的扩大。\n\n地图有多个岛屿，与其说是一个地图不如说是一个中世纪奇幻世界。非常适合探索！\n\n更新日志：\nUpdate #45 : 10 months agoOct 23, 2017Yo People!\n\n\n\n\nI've finished the new update for you guys and because a lot of people asked for it I included a download link too.\n\n\n\n\nhttps://imgur.com/gallery/YGz7L\n\nCheck the album for more pictures.\n\n\n\n\nThe new update includes plenty more locations like: Nordic Village, Pirate Bay,Volcanos, Sjors Castle, The new version of North Whitecliff, Castle Barracks, Farms etc..\n\n\n\n\nCheck the server if you want to, we got plenty more adventure for you :)\n\n\n\n\n\nUpdate #44 : 2 years agoFeb 13, 2017Hey Everyone!\n\nKingdom of Galekin 1.4 is finally here and I must say this is the biggest update so far. We've worked hard on making the Official Kingdom of Galekin Server as a lot of people asked for it and it's finally done, you can check it out now with mc version 1.11. The server's going to be constantly updated with new quests,build etc. Also the map got an update too, mainly focused on whitecliff, there's a new area (Whitecliff Industrial Area) with a big factory, quests and boss fight. There're 2 arenas for pvp and spleef for people who want to play it, also 10+ detailed buildings in South Whitecliff and a barracks for the big castle(download soon). North Whitecliff got some new builds too and made some terraforming all around the map. New Spawn was built too for new players. I had to remove the download link because a lot of people want to use it on their server and it can't work for us, I hope you can understand my decision, but you can always check out the map on our server and there's gon be a seperated creative server for people who only want to check out the map and maybe build some plots that can be copied into the main server. Thank you for all the support so far and new updates coming soon :) Have a nice day!\n\n\n\n\nUpdate #43 : 2 years agoOct 2, 20161.3 is finally done :)\n\nI've build a massive city south of Whitecliff with a big castle,cathedral,docks,lots of houses and a lot more :) check that out, download link is updated too. Also new minecraft videos coming soon with updates and the cinematic is already done, check the front page :)\n\n\n\n\nUpdate #42 : 4 years agoNov 5, 20141.2 is here finally with all the things completed, fixed a lot of stuff, added big mountains, big houses, new areas,lot of little details.All the interiors are completed, if you found something wrong with it tell me in the comments :)\n\n\n\n\nUpdate #41 : 4 years agoAug 6, 2014new update is done, with new pictures and download link\n\n\nredone a lot of things,fixed old locations and added some more detail,I've made a lot of interiors also\n\n\nthanks to jackjt8 again for the pics\n\n\n\n\nUpdate #40 : 4 years agoMay 15, 2014new update is here with a new download link, I've made a lot of changes and started rebuilding a lot of areas.\nnew renders added, made by reddit user jackjt8 and new overview of the map too.\n\n\n\n\nUpdate #39 : 4 years agoMar 6, 2014fixed the pigspawning glitch and a couple bugs with the map, now you can play it smooth, also I've edited the city adis and the castle with a harbor and a big ship\n\n\n\n\nUpdate #38 : 5 years agoJan 14, 2014hey everybody!
