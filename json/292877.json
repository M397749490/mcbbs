    "txt_content": " 本帖最后由 没糖的葫芦 于 2018-8-1 16:49 编辑 \n\nhttp://music.163.com/style/swf/widget.swf?sid=32358440&type=2&auto=1&width=320&height=66\nSmartMoving 灵活移动 这是一个(历史悠久的)好Mod 用起来特别方便 我也十分喜欢_(:з」∠)_但是最近发现BBS上的是断断续续的版本 而且有的不全\n所以就到原帖把所有版本 (Minecraft 1.0.0 - Minecraft 1.7.10) (Mod版本:1.0 - 15.1)都搬了过来\n部分资源来源于Crazy_Mark 十分感谢~\n嗯 进入正题(为什么有人吐槽我的帖子只有隐藏 看起来简洁点多好~)\n操作方法&特性介绍——(自己脑翻成果 如有错误欢迎指正 部分文本来源于919begin)\n攀沿天花板：\n这个MOD可以使你攀沿天花板上的栅栏\n当你在够得着的铁栅栏下方，跳上去并按住爬行Grab键后可以进行攀沿\n攀登藤蔓：\n当你安装该MOD后，即使藤蔓没有方块靠着，也可以进行攀沿\n当你靠近藤蔓后，按住Grab按钮和跳跃按钮后，开始攀登藤蔓。但是小心 当你松开按键后你会摔下去\n新的游泳和潜水动作：\n当你跳入水中，水至少要有两个方块深[本人注：亲测 从两格深的水游入一格深的水后仍然有效]才会有用\n按住跳跃键，你可以浮到水面上，并且你再也不用当心你松开跳跃键后会往下沉\n当你往前游泳时，你所游向的方向是你鼠标所指的地方\n当你在水中，你可以按Shift键来下潜\n新的飞行动作：\n这个MOD实现了更真实的飞行\n它完全是标准飞行动作，飞行的方向不再由方向键控制，而是你的鼠标[调好角度和(打开的)姿势]\n蓄力的跳跃：\n这个MOD可以使你跳的更加高\n当你按住Shift按钮和跳跃按钮时，你会发现一排蓄力的图标[本人注:如果没有其他MOD的话 应该是在生命条/护甲条上方 为蓝色的向上箭头]\n逐渐出现，蓄满松开后就可以跳的更加高！不再是只可以跳两格了！！[本人注:搭配Grab键可爬上四格高的墙]\n当你开始移动之后，你之前?ing with your head first will damage you more than hitting ground witr_Climbing_Smart_Mode]Smart Mode[/url]-inspired default values.\n\nFeature: Climbing along ceilings\n\nThis mod allows climbing along ceilings as long as the ceiling block supports it. Currently only the steel fence block and the closed trap door block support ceiling climbing.\n\nTo start climbing along ceilings hold the grab button when below, but not too far below, the climbable ceiling. To stop ceiling climbing simply release the grab button.\n\nIf wall climbing is also possible when pressing the grab button, wall climbing will start instead. In this case turn into the direction you want to move to start ceiling climbing.\n\n\nFeature: Climbing up vines\n\nTo start climbing up vines hold the grab button when in front of a vine and hold the jump button to start climbing up.\n\nTo stop climbing up just release the jump button. To stop climbing at all release the grab button.\n\n\nFeature: Configurable sneaking\n\nThis mod allows to configure the standard sneaking via the configuration file. The sneaking speed can set and sneakingcan be disabled at all.\n\nAdditionally sneaking can be made togglable. When toggled on it can be toggled off by pressing the sneak button again. This also works while swimming or diving.\n\n\nFeature: Alternative Swimming and Diving\n\nThis mod implements optional alternative swimming and diving behaviours.\n\nTo dive jump into still water that is at least two blocks deep. Then press and hold the forward button to dive. To steer use your mouse.\nTo swim stop holding the forward button and press and hold the jump button instead until you reach the surface. Then press and hold the forward button again to swim. To steer use your mouse again.\nTo dive again stop pressing the jump button and direct your mouse toward the depths.\n\nWhen you are walking in one block deep water you can switch to diving by pressing the sneak and then the grab button. If you press the jump button before the grab button you will switch to swimming instead.\n\nWhen you are swimming or divind in one block deep water you can switch to walking by pressing the grab button.\n\n\nFeature: Alternative Flying\n\nThis mod implements an optional alternative flying behaviour.\n\nIt completely replaces standard flying and allows you to fly up and down via looking. The standard flying jump to raise,sneak to fall behaviour has been reimplemented and works similar to its standard flying counterpart.\n\nAlternative flying can be started and ended just like standard flying by double clicking the jump button.\n\n\nFeature: Charged jumps\n\nThis mod implements optional, configurable charged jumps.\n\nTo start charging press and hold the jump button while sneaking on the spot. To jump either release the jump button or stop sneaking. The default maximum charge jump height is two blocks.\n\nWhen you start moving while charging the charge will be lost.\n\n\nFeature: Wall Jumping\n\nThis mod implements the possibility to wall jump from blocks.\n\nTo wall jump from a block press jump while being airborne, release it, and press it again before hitting the block you want to wall jump from horizontally. When you collide with the block - while not falling too fast allready - a wall jump will be triggered.\n\nYou can also head wall jump from a block instead by also pressing the grab button before hitting the block you want to wall jump from.\n\nTo cascade your wall jumps just keep pressing jump. To break your cascade release jump. Hitting the ground or head wall jumping will also break the cascade.\n\n\nFeature: Head Jumps\n\nThis mod implements the possibility to jump head first instead of head up.\n\nTo head jump start sprinting and press the grab and the jump button. When the jump button is released you will jump, head first, with a angle depending on how long you pressed the jump button.\n\nHitting ground while fallot present in the files, the corresponding default value will be used.\nThe option \"move.options.version\" will be used for cross version compatibility.\n更新日志[Change Log]——\n== Smart Moving 16.2 ==\n+ Added license information and improved
