After all, I've played more hours of Minecraft than I've actually been alive (somehow), and I recently completed that new Zelda game without cheating once! OK, I cheated four times but that's not 'once' then is it .\n我自恃是一位高玩。毕竟我在出生之前就开始玩Minecraft了（不知道怎么做到的），最近我还没作弊一次就通关了塞尔达传说！好吧，我作弊了四次，但四次可不等于一次。\n\nSo when Ben Barker and Chuck Zimmerman challenged me to try out their adventure map,HASTUR'S LABYRINTH, how could I say no?\n所以当 Ben Barker 和 Chuck Zimmerman 鼓动我试试他们的新冒险地图——哈斯塔地牢的时候，我怎么可能拒绝呢？\n\nOh how I wish I'd said no...\n但我多希望那时拒绝了啊……\n\n\nDon't get me wrong. Hastur's Labyrinth is far from a bad map. It's a challenging slice of claustraphobic Java fun that's well worth exploring! Just don't blame me if you end up smashing your computer into little angry pieces.\n不要会错意了，哈斯塔地牢并不是渣作。这张极具挑战性的地图非常值得患幽闭恐惧症的Java版玩家游玩！但先说好，如果你最后一拳把电脑打穿，我不背锅。\n\nBecause Hastur's Labyrinth is tough. Hastur's Labyrinth is more hardcore than the middle of a diamond apple. Hastur's Labyrinth is the reason I wake up in the middle of every night, screaming “Noooooooo! Not the rabbits! ANYTHING BUT THE RABBITS!”\n我这么说的原因是哈斯塔地牢困难无比：它比钻石苹果的核还要硬核。正是因为这张地图，每天晚上我会从床上惊坐起，大声叫喊——“不uuuuuu！兔兔你不要过来啊！你不要过来啊！”\n\n\nIt Begins\n伊始\n\nI awaken in a room full of levers, signs, buttons and lava dripping from the ceiling . I try and take my mind off this disturbing detail by admiring the two decapitated heads on the wall.\n我在一间满是拉杆、告示牌和按钮的屋中醒来，天花板上不时渗透下岩浆粒子。我试着欣赏墙上两颗被斩下的头颅，以分散我对岩浆的注意力。\n\nIt doesn't help.\n但这不起作用。\n\n看，多帅！这就是地图作者的样子！伙计们，快鞠躬！哦...抱歉，我们继续。\nYou can then choose from classes like Wizard, Barbarian, etc. In real life I'm weaker than a paper kitten, but in this labyrinth I'm a mighty WARRIOR!\n然后就可以选择职业：巫师、野蛮人，等等。在现实，也许我连纸老虎都打不过；但在这所迷宫里我可是一名响当当的武士！\n\nI slap on my warrior threads and enter the labyrinth! BRING IT.\n我选择成为武士，进入了迷宫。放马过来吧！\n\nI'm welcomed by none other than the voice of Hastur himself! His mysterious words inform me that he's been waiting for me . He advises me to “be sure to look for the hidden keys – we wouldn't want you losing your sanity looking for a way out.”\n刚上来我就接受了哈斯塔本尊声音的热切欢迎！他神秘的话语似乎在告谕我，他已恭候多时。他劝谏我“一定要寻找隐藏的钥匙，我们可不想因为找路让你的san值狂掉”。\n\nWow! What great advice! Thanks, Hastur!\n哇！苦口婆心，金玉良言！我可谢谢你，哈斯塔老哥！\n\n好吧，这几句话确实挺恐怖，但老兄，至少我知道怎么写“迷宫”两个字。\nOverflowing with confidence/sweat, I marched grandly into the first room. Oh, cool! There were some other adventurers in here too! Hello, my new best friends, how goes the daARGGGGGH!\n信心满溢（汗流浃背），我大步跨进第一间房。哦，帅气！也有别的冒险者在这！呦，我的新朋友，吃了吗您……啊啊啊啊啊啊啊！\n\nYeah, my bad. These are actually Doomshrooms. Groaning zombie warriors in strong armour that wasted no time in ripping the flesh from my bones. But I respawned, ran back into the room, raised my axe into the air and... died again. Darn it.\n好吧，我的锅。我的新朋友其实是毁灭菇。吼叫着的僵尸卫士身着重甲，争先恐后地扑到我的身前，把我做成了骨肉相连。但我复活了，跑回了这间房间，举起了我的斧头，然后——再次送了食材。该死！\n\nIt was time for some rapid clicking action. I could practically hear my mouse screaming as I swung my axe to victory! I'll admit to being a bit shaken up by this tough fight. That's why I was thrilled with the wonderful treat I found in the next room!\n是时候展现我的快速连点技巧了。我挥舞着斧头奔向胜利，我的鼠标便随着斧头的舞动呻吟。不得不承认，这场战斗些微动摇了我的内心。但这恰能解释我在下间房间里找到奖品的惊喜！\n\n现在来看，我当时把这些恐怖的面孔视为新朋友的思想还是too simple。但兄弟，你那冷嘲热讽的态度可永远都交不到挚友！\n\nThe creature in the next room was so adorable, I'm almost too ugly to describe it. It was an ickle-wickle cute-as--heck bunny rabbit! Called Dandelion! Aww, come here you aARRRGGGHHHH GETITOFF GETITOFF GETITOFF\n下间房里的怪物可爱至极，我自愧不如。看，是娇（邪）小（恶）可（见）爱（鬼）的小兔兔！它名叫Dandelion！噢，快过来，小家伙……啊啊啊啊啊啊啊啊！下来下来下来！\n\nIt killed me in less than four hops. Death by killer bunny rabbit. This must be whatever the opposite of 'peaking' is.\n我目睹了它的四次跳跃，然后就对世界说了再见。被可爱的杀手兔杀死，可能是我人生最大的污点了吧。\n\n“There's no shame in being defeated by a bunny rabbit,” said Marsh, before giving up and laughing loudly in my face for three straight weeks. He's still pointing at me and giggling now, chortling while I try to type this. Curse you, Marsh. And curse you, Dandelion .\n“被小兔兔杀死无需羞愧。”但之后马什还是没忍住，看着我的脸整整笑了三周。就在我在写这篇文章时，他还在指着我偷乐呢。诅咒你，马什。诅咒你，Dandelion。\n\n\n\n\n我与它四目相对，端详着它邪恶的面庞：惨白、蓬松，偏好胡萝卜。\nAfter a few more attempts (doesn't matter how many), in which the rabbits did get the hop on me a few times (again, the exact figure is irrelevant), I finally managed to defeat a bunny rabbit in armed combat!Told you I was hardcore!\n我又试了几次（多少次就别管了），杀手兔也确实干掉了我几次（再说一遍，多少次和文章无关），但经过激烈的战斗，我最终还是干掉了一只杀手兔！说过了，我是不朽的！\n\nMarsh has just informed me that I have to tell you the number of times the bunny rabbit killed me or I'm fired. 34. Thirty-four times.\n马什刚刚让我必须告诉你们杀手兔干掉我的总次数，不然我就会被炒鱿鱼。34。三十四次。\n\n...Let's move on, yeah?Please?\n...咱别笑了继续吧，行不行啊？\n\n\nWill I ever escape?\n我能逃出去吗？\n\nThe next room saw no break in the action. Immediately two warriors jumped out of the shadows, both of which were called 'Spartacus'.\n下间密室丝毫不给我喘息的机会，两名叫Spartacus的卫士从阴影中跳出。\n\n“No,I'm Spartacus!” I shouted. “Hahaha! Geddit? It's a reference! To a movie! I'm hilarious!”\n“不，我才是 Spartacus！”我朝他们吼道。“哈哈哈！懂了吗？我在玩梗！就是《斯巴达克斯》那部电影！我可真是个有趣的男人！”\n\nThey reacted to this by stabbing me repeatedly in the face. I suppose some people just don't appreciate classic cinema.\n面对我的即兴表演，他们选择用武器连刺我的帅气脸庞，我猜可能是因为他们不喜欢经典电影吧。\n\nBoth the Spartacus' (Spartacuses? Spartaci?) attacked! But I defeated them with ease, only dying a mere dozen more times. I was getting the hang of this! Ish! So I strolled happily into the next room, which was full of spiderwebs. Oh. Oh no no no no no no no no no . NO.\n两只 Spartacus' (Spartacuses？Spartaci?) 一起攻击！但我轻松的打败了他们，只尝试了那么几十次。我领会到了诀窍了，好啊！所以我欢欣地大步迈进下间房，只见得满眼蜘蛛网。哦我的天。别别别别别别别别别别。别啊！\n\n不*32\nA chill sprinting up my spine, I looked at the webs and wondered what was about to happen to me:\n一股寒意遍布我的脊背，我看向蜘蛛网，想象着会发生什么：\n\nBEST POSSIBLE OUTCOME: I'm about to meet Spider-Man!\n最好的结果：我能见到蜘蛛侠了！\n\nSADLY MUCH MORE LIKELY OUTCOME: Spiders.\n但骨感的现实可能是：蜘蛛的巢穴。\n\nWORST POSSIBLE OUTCOME:What if it's a man made out of spiders.\n更坏的结果：可能是蜘蛛人。\n\nSome people try and tell you that “spiders are more afraid of you than you are of them.” Oh really . So if I was a jet black, multi-eyed monster with eight (!) creepifying legs, do you really think I would fear a mere mortal man? OF COURSE I WOULDN'T. Those idiots are wrong and should be punished. Punished with spiders.\n有些人告诉你，“你害怕蜘蛛，但蜘蛛更怕你。”说的跟真的一样。试想，如果我是那只乌黑八眼八腿（！）怪，你觉得我会害怕平凡的人类吗？我 当 然 不\n 会！这些散布谣言的傻子就该惩罚——用蜘蛛来惩罚。\n\n汤姆喜欢的事物：蜘蛛侠。汤姆讨厌的事物：现实中的蜘蛛和人。\n\nTerrified, I cautiously crept through the cobwebs. The sticky spider-gunk slowed down my shaking legs. If a spider saw me, I'd never stand a chance of running away in time.\n我胆战心惊地穿过蛛网，颤抖的双腿被粘性的蛛丝拖慢。如果此时被蜘蛛发现，我绝对没机会及时逃走。\n\n“The trick is not to panic!” I screamed to myself.\n“战胜恐惧最好的方法就是面对恐惧！”我给自己打气。\n\nBut amazingly, I found no spiders. I found a chest! One with the first key inside! I'm the best adventurer of all time! A fact I celebrated by accidentily throwing my only weapon away!\n但令我惊讶的是，我没发现蜘蛛，却发现了一个箱子！打开看，里面竟然有一把钥匙！我怕不是历史上最棒的探险家！在庆祝这个事实的时候，我不小心把武器丢到了一边！\n\nWhoops.\n哦，天。\n\n唷，我的斧子就在眼前了！你想知道我身上散发的黄烟是什么？听着，伙计。如果你也经历了我所经历的一切，你的气味也不会有多香。\n\nMy precious axe retrieved (I'll never be stupid enough to lose that again!), I entered the toughest room yet. Have you ever played The Floor is Lava– the game where you pretend your carpet is made of lava and have to jump on your chairs/tables/grandparents/sturdier pets to avoid stepping on it? Well this room was a bit like that fun game! Except that the floor was literally lava .\n我宝贵的斧头回来了（我再也不会傻到弄丢武器了！）。接着，我进入了最困难的密室。你之前有没有玩过岩浆地板游戏？把你的地板想象成岩浆，你需要从椅子上跳到桌子上，从桌子上跳到家人身上，然后再从他们身上跳到强健的宠物上，目标是避免踩到“岩浆”。这间屋内就吸纳这游戏的精髓，唯一的不同便是，这里的地上确实都是岩浆。\n\nTo escape, I'd have to leap from tiny platform to tiny platform, all to reach that door. And for a man who'd recently been killed by a bunny over thirty times, I was feeling surprisingly confident.\n为了逃脱，我需要从一个小平台跳到另一个小平台，最后才能到出口。但作为一个刚被小兔兔干掉三十多次的人，我感觉十分自信。\n\nSee, I may not be much in combat, but Tom knows his jumping. I've mastered Mario, sped through Sonic, and ignored Blinx the Cat= I'm a platforming MASTER.\n看，我可能不是很擅长战斗，但我擅长跳跃啊。我精通马里奥，攻略过索尼克狂欢大冒险，通关过霹雳酷炫猫，我可是跑酷大师。\n\n\nI was going to propel from block to block like gravity meant nothing, to elegantly dance and bounce between the platforms like a ballerina made of springs. I slammed the 'jump' button, cheering my own brilliance!\n做好了跳跃的准备，我想象着自己无视重力在空中划过优美弧线，宛如灵巧鲜活的芭蕾舞者。在为自己的机智欢呼的同时，我按下了“跳跃”按钮。\n\nExcept that wasn't the jump button. It was the 'throw' button. So I threw my axe into the lava instead. It made a smoky hiss as it disappeared under the molten rock.\n一切顺利，除了我按的并不是“跳跃”按钮，而是“投掷”按钮。于是我的斧头划过优美弧线，掉入了岩浆。嘶嘶声从下方传来，烟雾从下方升起，它在炽热的熔岩中粉身碎骨。\n\nDammit Tom.\n该死的，我干了什么。\n\n我敢打赌，放这块告示牌的人肯定会被岩浆烧到。\nYou know what? Who needs an axe anyway? Yeah! Those overrated tree-choppers are nothing but trouble. True adventurers (like myself) get by with their fists. Their weak, shaking, freshly manicured fists. BRING. IT.\n你懂啥？哪个冒险家需要斧头？这些没用的砍树工具只能给你带来麻烦。真正的冒险家（就像我）都是用拳头说话的，用他们虚弱、颤抖、刚修过指甲的拳头。放马过来吧！\n\nUnfortunately, the deadly skeleton in the next room did bring it. And it hurt. It hurt a lot .\n不幸的是，下间密室中的骷髅确实有两把刷子。这箭打在身上疼。很疼。\n\nThe skeleton used its enchanted bow to fill my head full of arrows. “Arrows!” I thought. I mean to think “ow!” but in my defence, my brain was literally full of arrows.\n这只骷髅用它的附魔弓在我的脑袋上插满箭矢。“箭[sup]2[/sup]！”我本来想喊“嗷”，但此时我必须为自己辩解，因为我的脑袋正如字面意思所说，已经插满箭了。\n\nStill, I wasn't going down without a fight. I punched, kicked, squealed and begged the skeleton to leave me alone.\n但是，战斗是无法避免的。拳打脚踢，尖叫啼哭，下跪求饶，一气呵成。\n\n噢！啊！呕！咿！吼！嗷嗷嗷！别打脸，兄弟别打脸，拜托了别打脸！\n\nBut the skeleton's onslaught was unrelenting! Soon there were more arrows in my face than teeth. Then more arrows in my head than hair. Luckily, I'm losing my hair, so this wasn't as bad as it sounds. Still too many arrows though.\n但骷髅的猛攻仍然莫得感情！过不一会，我脸上的箭比牙齿还多，头上的箭比头发还多。幸运的是，我在脱发，所以听起来没那么糟糕，但我已经变成刺猬了！ \n\nIt wasn't easy taking it down with my bare hands, but eventually the skeleton was defeated. I would have jumped for joy, if there hadn't been about a hundred arrows securing me to the wall.\n虽说用拳头并不容易，但我最终还是干掉了那只骷髅。要不是百来只箭把我钉在了墙上，我会欢呼雀跃的。\n\nSafe in the knowledge that I'd beaten the worst this dungeon could throw at me, I opened the next door and almost walked into a waterfall. Er.... what?\n感觉我战胜了地牢最险恶的部分，我打开了下间房门，几乎跌入瀑布。额...什么？\n\n\nMy Damp Destiny\n我阴湿的命运\n\n\n\n\nSeems I'd have to swim my way through the next room. How long can you hold your breath? I always assumed I could hold mine for eight weeks, but it turned out to actually be closer to eight seconds. I had to keep desperately backstroking out of the room, filling my lungs with delicious dungeon air, then paddling back in for another go.\n看起来我得游过这里才能抵达下一间房间。你能憋气多久呢？我以前觉得，我能坚持七八五十六天不带喘气儿的，但现实却是连八秒都不到。我需要不断游回起点，让宝贵的地牢空气充斥全身各处组织，然后再回去尝试。\n\nFinally, I found another doorway. How deep was I into this labyrinth now? I'd only found one key – could I really find them all? Or was I destined to stay down here... forever?\n最后，我找到了另一扇门。我在地牢里推进了多深了？我只找到了一把钥匙——我真能找到全部吗？还是我会永远被困在这里？\n\nShuddering at that terrible thought, I shoved open the door and collapsed back on dry land. Another room. Another danger. I stood up, saw what was in the room with me, and gasped. Impossible!\n想到这里我打了个寒颤。打开面前的门，我再也支撑不住，倒在了干燥的地上。又是一间新房间，又会面临新危险。我爬起来，看到了房间里的东西，大口喘息。 不可能的！\n\n\nTo Be Continued...\n未完待续...\n\nPsst! Think you can do better than Tom at this labyrinth? We agree! Prove you've got what it takes by finding Hastur's Labyrinth here .\n嘿！觉得你能比汤姆玩得更好？点击这里证明你自己吧！\n\n【c7w 译自官网 2017 年 06 月 26 日发布的 Dungeon Creeper!】\n【本文排版借助了：SPX】【2020年3月8日】\n\nD U N G E O N   C R E E P E R !\n爬 行 者 地 牢\nCan Tom survive the horrors of Hastur's Labyrinth?\nTom能从哈斯塔地牢中逃脱吗？\n\n\n\n　　I like to think I'm pretty good at games. After all, I've played more hours of Minecraft than I've actually been alive (somehow), and I recently completed that new Zelda game without cheating once! OK, I cheated four times but that's not 'once' then is it.\n　　我认为我很擅长游戏。毕竟，我玩Minecraft的时间比我真实生存的时间还长（莫名其妙），并且我最近还在没有一次作弊的情况下通关了最新的塞尔达游戏！好吧，我作弊了四次，但不是“一次”。\n\nSo when Ben Barker and Chuck Zimmerman challenged me to try out their adventure map, HASTUR'S LABYRINTH, how could I say no?\n　　所以当Ben Barker和Chuck Zimmerman向我发出挑战，让我尝试他们最新的冒险地图《哈斯塔地牢》时，我怎么能说不呢？Oh how I wish I'd said no...\n　　哦，我多么希望我那时拒绝了……Don't get me wrong. Hastur's Labyrinth is far from a bad map. It's a challenging slice of claustraphobic Java fun that's well worth exploring! Just don't blame me if you end up smashing your computer into little angry pieces.\n　　不要想错了。《哈斯塔地牢》离差的地图很远，它是一张具有挑战性的地图，很值得去探索。如果你将你的电脑打成了愤怒的碎片的话，不要责怪我就好了。Because Hastur's Labyrinth is tough. Hastur's Labyrinth is more hardcore than the middle of a diamond apple. Hastur's Labyrinth is the reason I wake up in the middle of every night, screaming “Noooooooo! Not the rabbits! ANYTHING BUT THE RABBITS!”\n　　因为哈斯塔地牢很坚固，它比钻石苹果的核还坚固。哈斯塔地牢是我每晚半夜醒来并尖叫的原因——“不！！！不要兔子！！！其它什么都可以，不要兔子！！！”IT BEGINS\n　它开始了I awaken in a room full of levers, signs, buttons and lava dripping from the ceiling. I try and take my mind off this disturbing detail by admiring the two decapitated heads on the wall.\n　　我在一间满是拉杆，告示牌，按钮和天花板上渗透着岩浆的房间内醒来。我尝试“欣赏”房间墙上的两个头颅来转移我大脑在这烦恼事件中的注意力。It doesn't help.\n　　但那没作用。Oh, cool! It's a cameo from the guys who made this map! Take a bow, fellas! Oh... right, yeah. Sorry.\n　　哦，多么酷！这是做地图的两个人的头颅！鞠躬，伙计们！哦……额，好，抱歉。You can then choose from classes like Wizard, Barbarian, etc. In real life I'm weaker than a paper kitten, but in this labyrinth I'm a mighty WARRIOR!\n　　然后你可以选择职业，像巫师，原始人等等。在现实生活中，我甚至比纸做的小猫还弱，但在这魔宫中我可是勇士！I slap on my warrior threads and enter the labyrinth! BRING IT.\n　　我随意地穿上了我的勇士装备然后进入的迷宫中。放马过来吧！\n\n　　I'm welcomed by none other than the voice of Hastur himself! His mysterious words inform me that he's been waiting for me. He advises me to “be sure to look for the hidden keys – we wouldn't want you losing your sanity looking for a way out.”\n　　我被哈斯塔它自己的叫声所欢迎。它神秘的话语告知我它已经等候我多时了。它建议我“一定要寻找隐藏的钥匙”——我们不想让你失去想找路出去的正常神志。Wow! What great advice! Thanks, Hastur!\n　　哦哦！多么棒的建议啊！感谢你，哈斯塔！\n\n\n　　OK, those are pretty spooky words, but at least I know how to spell the word 'labyrinth', buddy.\n　　Overflowing with confidence/sweat, I marched grandly into the first room. Oh, cool! There were some other adventurers in here too! Hello, my new best friends, how goes the daARGGGGGH!\n　　好，这些话语看起来很像幽灵，但至少我知道怎么拼写单词“迷宫”，朋友。带着溢出的信心与汗水，我盛大地游行进入了第一个房间。哦，酷！在这儿也有其他的冒险者！嗨，我的新朋友，是的！\n\n　　Yeah, my bad. These are actually Doomshrooms. Groaning zombie warriors in strong armour that wasted no time in ripping the flesh from my bones. But I respawned, ran back into the room, raised my axe into the air and... died again. Darn it.\n　　好的，我的错误。他们其实是毁灭菇——穿戴着厚重护甲，呻吟着的僵尸守卫者——他们不想浪费任何时间撕裂我骨头间的肉。但是我重生了，然后我跑回了这个房间，将我的斧头举到了空气中然后——又死了。真讨厌。It was time for some rapid clicking action. I could practically hear my mouse screaming as I swung my axe to victory! I'll admit to being a bit shaken up by this tough fight. That's why I was thrilled with the wonderful treat I found in the next room!\n　　这是一些快速点击行为的考验。在我挥动我的斧子走向胜利的时候，我实际上能够听见我的鼠标的尖叫声。我承认我在这场硬仗中有点动摇了。但这也是我在下个房间中发现了惊人宝藏后欣喜若狂的原因。In hindsight, it may have been a little na?ve of me to assume these horrorshows were wonderful new friends ready to get their hug on. But you'll never get a BFF with that cynical attitude, chum!\nThe creature in the next room was so adorable, I'm almost too ugly to describe it. It was an ickle-wickle cute-as--heck bunny rabbit! Called Dandelion! Aww, come here you aARRRGGGHHHH \n　　事后想想，我将这些恐怖的生物假定为准备去拥抱我的新朋友，我还是太天真（Naive！）了。但你用愤世嫉俗的态度是永远不会得到长久的朋友的，我的朋友！下间房间的生物是如此的可爱，相比较而言我是那么的丑陋以至于我甚至不能去描述它们。它们是可爱到见鬼的小兔子！它们叫做“蒲公英”！噢，你过来！GETITOFF GETITOFF GETITOFF\n　　它过来了！它过来了！它过来了！It killed me in less than four hops. Death by killer bunny rabbit. This must be whatever the opposite of 'peaking' is.\n　　它在四次跳跃之内就能杀死我。因杀手兔而死——这可能就是“巅峰之时”的对立面。“There's no shame in being defeated by a bunny rabbit,” said Marsh, before giving up and laughing loudly in my face for three straight weeks. He's still pointing at me and giggling now, chortling while I try to type this. Curse you, Marsh. And curse you, Dandelion.\n　　“被小兔子打败是没有遗憾的，”Marsh在我放弃之前说，他看着我的脸大声地笑了三周。他现在仍然在看着我咯咯地笑，在看我打这句话的时候哈哈大笑。诅咒你，Marsh；诅咒你，“蒲公英”。\n\n\n　　Truly, I've stared into its eyes and endured the face of evil - It's white, fluffy and partial to carrots. \n　　真的，我盯着它的眼睛，忍受着邪恶的脸——它是白色的，毛茸茸的，并且它喜欢胡萝卜。\n\nAfter a few more attempts (doesn't matter how many), in which the rabbits did get the hop on me a few times (again, the exact figure is irrelevant), I finally managed to defeat a bunny rabbit in armed combat! Told you I was hardcore!\n　　在更多次尝试以后（不要在乎是多少次），即在小兔子踩在我的脸上多次以后（再说一遍，确切的数字是无关紧要的），我最终设法武装打败了这只小兔子！告诉你，我的毅力可是如铁杆！Marsh has just informed me that I have to tell you the number of times the bunny rabbit killed me or I'm fired. 34. Thirty-four times.\n　　Marsh告诉了我我要告诉你们我被杀手兔杀掉的次数——34.三十四次！...Let's move on, yeah? Please?\n　　让我们继续吧，嗯？好吗？WILL I EVER ESCAPE?\n　　我能够逃脱吗？The next room saw no break in the action. Immediately two warriors jumped out of the shadows, both of which were called 'Spartacus'.\n　　下一间房间在行动上不会有任何的破坏。突然两个守卫者从阴影中跳了出来，它们都叫做“斯巴达克斯”。\n\n　　“No, I'm Spartacus!” I shouted. “Hahaha! Geddit? It's a reference! To a movie! I'm hilarious!”\n　　“不，我才是斯巴达克斯！”我吼道。“哈哈哈！懂吗？这是参照电影！我多么幽默！”\n\n　　They reacted to this by stabbing me repeatedly in the face. I suppose some people just don't appreciate classic cinema.\n　　它们通过直接刺伤我来做出回应。我猜想一些人不会感激经典电影。Both the Spartacus' (Spartacuses? Spartaci?) attacked! But I defeated them with ease, only dying a mere dozen more times. I was getting the hang of this! Ish! So I strolled happily into the next room, which was full of spiderwebs. Oh. Oh no no no no no no no no no. NO.\n　　两个斯巴达克斯（斯巴塔克斯？斯巴塔司？）向我发动了攻击！但我轻松打败了它们——仅仅死了几十次。我找到诀窍了！耶！所以我散步进了下一间房间——充满了蜘蛛网。哦，哦不不不不不不不不不。不！\nNo no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no\n　　不不不不不不不不不不不不不不不不不不不不不不不不不不不不不不不不\n　　A chill sprinting up my spine, I looked at the webs and wondered what was about to happen to me:\n　　突如其来的寒意冲击了我的脊柱，我盯着蜘蛛网并且想知道接下来什么会发生在我身上：\nBEST POSSIBLE OUTCOME: I'm about to meet Spider-Man!\n　　最好的结果：我可能会见到蜘蛛侠！SADLY MUCH MORE LIKELY OUTCOME: Spiders.\n　　悲伤一点的结果：蜘蛛们。WORST POSSIBLE OUTCOME: What if it's a man made out of spiders.\n　　可能是最坏的结果——由蜘蛛制成的人。Some people try and tell you that “spiders are more afraid of you than you are of them.” Oh really. So if I was a jet black, multi-eyed monster with eight (!) creepifying legs, do you really think I would fear a mere mortal man? OF COURSE I WOULDN'T. Those idiots are wrong and should be punished. Punished with spiders.\n　　有些人可能尝试告诉你——“蜘蛛看见你，它们可能比你看到他们更害怕。”哦，确实是这样。所以如果我是黑色的多眼怪，有八条爬行的腿，你认为我会怕一个平凡人吗？当然我不会！这些傻瓜错的很彻底，它们应该被丢到蜘蛛堆里惩罚。\nThings Tom does like: Spider-Man. Spider-Men. Things Tom doesn't like: Real spiders. Real men.\nTerrified, I cautiously crept through the cobwebs. The sticky spider-gunk slowed down my shaking legs. If a spider saw me, I'd never stand a chance of running away in time.\n　　Tom的确喜欢：蜘蛛侠和蜘蛛侠们。\n　　Tom不喜欢：真正的蜘蛛，真正的人。\n　　我在蜘蛛网间匍匐前进。这些粘性的脏东西减缓了我在移动的腿，放慢了我的速度。如果一只蜘蛛看见我，我没有及时逃跑的时间。\n“The trick is not to panic!” I screamed to myself.\n　　“诀窍就是不要惊慌！”我自己尖叫道。But amazingly, I found no spiders. I found a chest! One with the first key inside! I'm the best adventurer of all time! A fact I celebrated by accidentily throwing my only weapon away!\n　　但惊人的是，我没有发现蜘蛛。我发现了一个箱子！里面有第一把钥匙！无论什么时候我都是最棒的冒险者！我通过不小心将我唯一一把武器扔掉了的方式庆祝！Whoops.\n　　哎呦。Phew, my axe is within reach! You're wondering what that yellow smoke is that's coming off me? Look, pal. If you'd been through what I've been through, you wouldn't smell too hot either.\nMy precious axe retrieved (I'll never be stupid enough to lose that again!), I entered the toughest room yet. Have you ever played The Floor is Lava – the game where you pretend your carpet is made of lava and have to jump on your chairs/tables/grandparents/sturdier pets to avoid stepping on it? Well this room was a bit like that fun game! Except that the floor was literally lava.\n　　哎呀，我的斧头触手可及。你想知道我身体里冒出的黄烟是什么？看，朋友，如果你在经历我经历的事情，你也不会感到太热。我取回了我珍贵的斧头（我不会傻到把它再丢掉了！）我进入了最坚固的房间。你玩过“地板是岩浆”游戏吗？——你假装你的地毯全都是岩浆，你需要跳到你的椅子上，桌子上，祖父母身上，强壮的宠物身上来避免踩到岩浆上。很好，这个房间有点像那个有趣的游戏！唯一不同的是地板确确实实是真正的岩浆。To escape, I'd have to leap from tiny platform to tiny platform, all to reach that door. And for a man who'd recently been killed by a bunny over thirty times, I was feeling surprisingly confident.\n　　要想逃脱，我需要从小平台跨越到另一个小平台上——为了到达门的旁边。并且对于一个最近被小兔子杀死超过30次的人来说，我有着惊人的自信。See, I may not be much in combat, but Tom knows his jumping. I've mastered Mario, sped through Sonic, and ignored Blinx the Cat = I'm a platforming MASTER.\n　　看，我可能不是很了解战斗，但是Tom很了解跳跃。我精通超级马里奥，通过声波加速并且忽略布林克斯猫 = 我是平台跳跃的精通者。I was going to propel from block to block like gravity meant nothing, to elegantly dance and bounce between the platforms like a ballerina made of springs. I slammed the 'jump' button, cheering my own brilliance!\n　　我在平台之上一个方块一个方块的推进，这里的重力早已没有意义，在平台之间优雅地跳舞与弹跳，就像用弹簧制成的芭蕾舞演员一般。我猛地按下了“跳跃”按钮，展示自己的才华！Except that wasn't the jump button. It was the 'throw' button. So I threw my axe into the lava instead. It made a smoky hiss as it disappeared under the molten rock.\n　　除了那不是跳跃按钮，那是“丢出”按钮。所以我将我的斧头扔到了岩浆里。在它融于延迟消失的时候，它制造了烟雾弥漫的嘶嘶声。Dammit Tom.\n　　该死的Tom。Y'know, I'm willing to bet that whoever had the job of putting this sign up got burnt by that lava.\nYou know what? Who needs an axe anyway? Yeah! Those overrated tree-choppers are nothing but trouble. True adventurers (like myself) get by with their fists. Their weak, shaking, freshly manicured fists. BRING. IT.\n　　你知道，我愿意打赌放置这个牌子的人会被岩浆灼伤。你知道吗？谁还要一把斧头呢？耶！那些砍树用的东西没有任何作用，只会给我制造麻烦。真正的冒险者（就像我）用他们的拳头继续战斗下去。他们的软弱与颤抖都被拳头所修补。放马过来吧！Unfortunately, the deadly skeleton in the next room did bring it. And it hurt. It hurt a lot.\n　　不幸的是，下间房间的死亡骷髅确实“放马过来”了。那很疼——特别疼。The skeleton used its enchanted bow to fill my head full of arrows. “Arrows!” I thought. I mean to think “ow!” but in my defence, my brain was literally full of arrows.\n　　骷髅使用它的附魔弓让我的脑袋上插满了箭矢。“箭矢！”我想道。我可能是想“嗷！”但在我的辩护下，我的脑袋全是字面上的“箭”。Still, I wasn't going down without a fight. I punched, kicked, squealed and begged the skeleton to leave me alone.\n　　没有武器，我仍然不会沮丧。我推，踢，尖叫并且祈求骷髅“别管我”。Owch! Argh! Oof! Eeep! Groan! Ow ow ow! Not the face! Please, not the face! I SAID NOT THE FACE\n　　哦！啊！哦！噫！哦 哦 哦！不要打脸！请不要打脸！我说 请不要打脸！But the skeleton's onslaught was unrelenting! Soon there were more arrows in my face than teeth. Then more arrows in my head than hair. Luckily, I'm losing my hair, so this wasn't as bad as it sounds. Still too many arrows though.\n　　但骷髅的猛攻十分无情！不就在我的脸上的箭矢数量就比我的牙齿还多，在我头上的箭矢数量比我的头发还多。幸运的是，我正在脱发，所以这并没有听上去那么糟糕。但是仍然有很多箭矢。It wasn't easy taking it down with my bare hands, but eventually the skeleton was defeated. I would have jumped for joy, if there hadn't been about a hundred arrows securing me to the wall.\n　　用我光秃秃的手打败它并不简单，但最终骷髅被打败了。如果一百多只箭矢没有把我钉在墙上的话，我一定会快乐地跳起来的。Safe in the knowledge that I'd beaten the worst this dungeon could throw at me, I opened the next door and almost walked into a waterfall. Er.... what?\n　　放心，我已经打败了这地牢最坏的怪物，我打开了下一扇门走到了瀑布之中。额……啥？MY DAMP DESTINY\n　　我潮湿的命运Seems I'd have to swim my way through the next room. How long can you hold your breath? I always assumed I could hold mine for eight weeks, but it turned out to actually be closer to eight seconds. I had to keep desperately backstroking out of the room, filling my lungs with delicious dungeon air, then paddling back in for another go.\n　　似乎我需要游泳游到下间房间了。你一次能够屏住呼吸多长时间？我经常加装我一次能够八个星期，但其实是它非常接近八秒。我一直在拼命的逃脱出这个房间，用美味的地牢空气填满我的肺，然后划船回来再继续。Finally, I found another doorway. How deep was I into this labyrinth now? I'd only found one key – could I really find them all? Or was I destined to stay down here... forever?\n　　最终，我找到了另一扇门。我在这地牢里多久了？我仅仅找到了一把钥匙——我能找到全部的钥匙吗？难道我的命运是……永远待在这儿吗？\n\n　　Shuddering at that terrible thought, I shoved open the door and collapsed back on dry land. Another room. Another danger. I stood up, saw what was in the room with me, and gasped. Impossible!\n　　因那可怕想法而颤抖的我，推开了另一扇门，又回到了干燥的陆地上。又一间房间。又是新的危险。我站了起来，看着房间中有什么东西，大口喘气。不可能的！\n\n\n官网：未完待续\n\n\n地图地址 https://www.planetminecraft.com/project/18-hasturs-labyrinthe/博文地址 https://minecraft.net/en-us/article/dungeon-creeper-0发布者 Tom Stone发布时间 2017/06/26\n译者 c7w\n\n\n\n\n",
