sprites are now data-drivenUpdated documentation for new data-driven features\nAdmire Item ComponentMobs can now admire items they pick up or receive during an interaction. For a mob to admire an item they need to have both the admire_item goal and the admire_item component, and the relevant configuration need to be done in the interact component and/or the shareables component\nAngry ComponentSeveral new variables have been introduced to the angry componentGoal Variables\nbroadcast_anger_on_attack - If true the mob will send a pulse of brodcast anger whenever it attacks, broadcast_anger must also be true for this to workbroadcast_anger_on_being_attacked - If true the mob will send a pulse of brodcast anger whenever it is attacked, broadcast_anger must also be true for this to workangry_sound - The sound event to play when the mob is angrysound_interval - The range of time in seconds to randomly wait before playing the sound again\n\nAvoid Mob Type GoalSeveral new variables have been introduced to the avoid_mob_type goalGoal Variables\navoid_mob_sound - The sound event to play when the mob is angrysound_interval - The range of time in seconds to randomly wait before playing the sound again\n\nBarter ComponentMobs can now barter when they pick up items, or when they receive an item during an interaction. For a mob to barter they need to have both the barter goal and the barter component, and the relevant configuration need to be done in the interact component and/or the shareables componentComponent Variables\nbarter_table - A path to a loot table, which is used to determine what items the mob gives out during bartercooldown_after_being_attacked - Specifies for how long the goal will be unavailable after the mob is attacked, the default value is 0\nBarter Goal\nMobs can now barter when they pick up items, or when they receive an item during an interaction. For a mob to barter they need to have both the barter goal and the barter component, and the relevant configuration need to be done in the interact component and/or the shareables component\nGoal Variables\npriority - Specifies how the mob should prioritize this goal\n\nCelebrate Hunt ComponentSpecifies that the mob should have the hunt celebration behaviorComponent Variables\nbroadcast - If true, celebration will be broadcasted to other entities in the radius. Default value is trueradius - If broadcast is enabled, specifies the radius in which it will notify other entities for celebration. Default value is 16duration - Duration, in seconds, of celebration. Default value is 4celeberation_targets - The list of conditions that target of hunt must satisfy to initiate celebrationcelebrate_sound - The sound event to play when the mob is celebratingsound_interval - The range of time in seconds to randomly wait before playing the sound again\n\nEquip Item ComponentMobs can now equip armor and weapons that they pick up\nEquip Item GoalMobs can now equip armor and weapons that they pick up\nInteract ComponentComponent Variables\nbarter - If true the mob will try to activate the barter goal after the interaction, default value is falseadmire - If true the mob will try to activate the admire goal after the interaction, default value is false\n\nMoveToLavaGoalAdded the MoveToLava goal, similar to MoveToWater goal. Mob tries to find and move to lava\nNavigation ComponentNavigation component now has can_path_over_lava and can_walk_in_lava parameters, allowing mobs (like the strider) to traverse lava\nPanic GoalChanged the priority from the damage type to the \"ignore_mob_damage\" flag (if that flag is set and a mob attacks the mob with the Panic Goal, they will not panic even if the damage type matches one in their \"damage_sources\" list)Changed damage types from being hard-coded to being data-driven using the existing \"Entity Damage Sources\"Changed the default from \"fire, fire_tick, magma\" (old, hardcoded behavior) to \"all\"Pre-1.16 mobs will default to \"fire, fire_tick, magma\"\nPickup Items GoalThe PickupItemsGoal only considers items that the mob can reach\nWhen determining whether the goal can be used, we now check whether the mob can reach an item it’s interested in, before committing to it as the target of the goal. This is to avoid mobs getting stuck in this goal after deciding to pick up an item they cannot reach\nPickupBasedOnChance variable\nThis new variable was added to be used for monsters that can pick up items sometimes but also preserve mobs that used this goal in the past like Villagers. If this variable is true, the mob will have a calculation done (based on things like time played by the player, game difficulty, and moon brightness) to determine if this is a mob that is allowed to pick up items. That value is only calculated on the mob’s first spawn, which means it is forever saved on that mob and doesn’t change. If the variable is false (which it is by default), the mob will always be able to pick up items using the goal\nCanPickupAnyItem variable\nThe PickupItemsGoal is dependent on the ShareableComponent and the items that are added to its items list. This new variable overrides that list and tells the component that this mob can pick up any item even if it isn’t in the list. Items picked up because of this variable still honor the priority set to items in the list of items, however. This means that any items with a set priority in the list will still be picked up over any item that may be picked up because of this variable. By default, it is set to false\nCooldownAfterBeingAttacked variable\nThe variable cooldown_after_being_attacked has been added to the goal, specifying for how many seconds after being attacked the goal should be unavailable. The default value is 0\nCanPickupToHandOrEquipment variable\nSpecifying if the mob can equip items that it picks up or put items in its hand, or if it belongs in the inventory\n\nShareable ComponentComponent Variables\nitem/barter - If true the mob will try to activate the barter goal after picking up the item, default value is falseitem/admire - If true the mob will try to activate the admire goal after picking up the item, default value is falseitem/consume_item - Specifies if an item should be consumed, for instance Piglins consume (eat) porkchop. Default value is falseitem/stored_in_inventory - Specifies if the item is desired to be picked up and stored in the mob’s inventory. Default value is false\n\nSplash TextThe Splash Text loading code has been augmented to allow splash text JSON files to be additive, rather than replacing them completely, and to allow some conditional statements to disable splash text entries. Use a field called \"canMerge\" that sits next to the \"splashes\" field, it is a bool that defaults to 'false'. Also, another sibling of \"splashes\" is \"conditional\", which is an array of objects. Those objects contain a \"requires\" field and a \"splashes\" field. The \"splashes\" field is an array of strings like the original \"splashes\" field, and the \"requires\" field contains three fields - \"platforms\", \"treatments\", and \"stores\", each of which is an array of strings that is compared with the relevant data\nFixes and ChangesMade several Bedrock Dedicated Server documentation updates and fixes (BDS-1084, BDS-1085, BDS-2341, BDS-3051, BDS-3141)The \"minecraft:density_limit\" component is now documented in the Spawn Rules documentation section (MCPE-61126)Item tags can now be toggled in the UI using '/gamerule' showtagsAdded a new loop mode to animations - Now instead of omitting \"loop\" to have it stop playing when finished, or setting \"loop\": true to have it loop when finished, you can now say \"loop\": \"hold_on_last_frame\" to keep applying the last frame of animation (MCM-675)Optimized sound loading - \"load_on_low_memory\" is now deprecated in sound_definitions.json, as all audio can now play on low memory devicesRemoved type property from \"minecraft:shooter\" as it was never usedUpdated \"minecraft:spawn_entity\" to have an internal entities object or arrayAdded \"attack_chance\" to the \"minecraft:behavior.defend_village_target\" goalFixed removed or destroyed entities querying as valid in scriptInvalid items in the \"spawn_item\" field of a \"minecraft:spawn_entity\" now display an error\"StompEggGoal\" no longer uses \"search_count\" as it now searches all blocks in the specified areaImplemented 'AvoidMobTypeDefinition' and converted hardcoded properties to be data-drivenA content error will now appear if you provide an invalid item name to 'minecraft:interact' in the 'transform_to_item' fieldAdded documentation for 'minecraft:density_limit' (MCPE-61126)Adding a new subject to filters so damage sensors can filter on projectilesCustom brewing recipes can now output non-potion itemsImplemented a fix to the player's mount that ensures consistent, smooth rotation for all ridersCustom bones in geometry now respect their custom parent bones' transformationsThe 'delayed_attack' behavior no longer causes mobs to freeze when they lose their targetFixed the \"MeleeAttackGoal\" to allow entities to hit target entities beneath themA content error will now show up if you provide an invalid item name to \"minecraft:interact\" in the \"transform_to_item\" fieldThe 'on_unleash' event is now triggered correctly when unleashing from a fenceThe 'Create New World' button text is now using the global color componentCustom entities that use the runtime identifier field now use the custom entity's name rather than the vanilla entity's name (MCPE-56229)Fixed collision boxes not updating from the 'collision_box' scripting componentFunctions with any invalid commands (E.g. incorrect selector syntax) will no longer register and cannot be called (MCPE-64770)Fixed an issue where sounds would sometimes have incorrect settings applied to them, causing 2D sounds to play as 3D and vice versaComments in JSON arrays no longer cause an error (MCPE-40873)Entities no longer freeze when a component group containing a navigation component is removedThe 'damage_sensor' component will now work on non-mob actors (Such as Ender Crystals)Dispensed splash and lingering potions now have potion effects in their projectile component'pre_effect_script' no longer runs when an entity is despawning with 'minecraft:despawn'Fixed a bug where custom mobs with the 'runtime_identifier' field set would not return a custom mob spawn egg, if one was availableA mob spawned in the air will no longer think it's on the ground once its movement is ticked and the 'on_ground' filter no longer always returns trueBee spawn eggs can now be editedFixed an issue that could cause the 'minecraft:timer' component to fire prematurely in some conditionsFixed an issue that was causing particle animations to become invertedUsing the 'minecraft:pushable' component will no longer break older contentFixed an issue that was preventing animation controllers in Behavior Packs from running on dedicated servers and Realms (MCPE-59881)Fixed \"navigation.walk\" to handle the case where it is used on a flying entity, so that the flying entity will not cause lag while it is touching the ground\n\n\n\n正版地址Google Playhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mojang.minecraftpeWin10 Storehttps://www.microsoft.com/zh-cn/store/p/minecraft-for-windows-10/9nblggh2jhxj\n\n外部来源以及详细的更新条目追踪\nMinecraft官网（内容英文）Jeb的Twitter（英文）Jason的Twitter（英文）Matt Booty的Twitter（英文）tomcc的Twitter（英文）MattGartzke的Twitter（英文）HelenAngel的Twitter（英文）Chupacaubrey的Twitter（英文）Minecraft官方论坛（英文）Minecraft博客（英文）\n",
