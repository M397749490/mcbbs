That means players on those platforms will be able to join each other in-game, create, cooperate or compete together on massive servers, and access whatever swish skins and Marketplace adventure maps they own on any of their compatible devices. You can read more about the fancy features coming with the update here.\n\n就像你所听到的那样，我们将很快发布独乐不如众乐更新——这是我们统一Minecraft的主机板、移动版和win10版计划的第一步。这意味着，在这些平台上的玩家将能加入彼此，在大型服务器中建造、合作或是竞争，并读取他们在任何与之兼容的设备上拥有的所有皮肤和在市场上的冒险地图。你可以在这里发现更多关于这一次更新的特性。\n\nIf you own Minecraft: Xbox One Edition or Minecraft: Nintendo Switch Edition, you’ll receive the brand new version of Minecraft for free (and, don't worry, if you're attached to the old console version, you can still play that too). To make sure it’s all going to work properly, however, we’re rolling out a beta on Windows 10 and Android today, with Xbox One beta access to follow in the coming days!\n\n如果你拥有Xbox One版或任天堂Switch版，你都可以免费获得新版的Minecraft（而且如果你与旧的主机板本相连，你也可以游玩，不用担心）。不过，为了确保一切都运行正常，我们今天先会在Windows 10平台和Android平台上推出测试版，在接下来的几天里，Xbox One也将会推出测试版。\n\nAs with all betas, the purpose is to help us stress-test what we’ve built so far and uncover any bugs so we can squish them before the official launch. So: expect some things to go wrong! It’s all part of the process of making sure they go right in the future!\n\n和所有的beta测试版一样，我们的主要目的是测试目前所发布的新特性，并在正式发布之前发现和修复bug。所以我们期待着游戏会出错！这都是为了确保他们能在将来走向正确的道路。\n\nThe pay-off is that you get an early glimpse of the cool stuff we have lined up, like fireworks, parrots, armor stands, the recipe book, new game rules and - stealing the show entirely - the amazing, the one and only, the ultimate COARSE DIRT.\n\n结果是，你可以早早看到新版本中那些很酷的东西，比如烟花、鹦鹉、护甲、合成书、新的游戏规则，以及偷偷欣赏这场精彩演出的、令人惊叹的、唯一存在的而又粗糙的泥土（bug）。\n\nWe're not releasing all of Better Together's planned features in one go, however. Servers aren't yet in the beta (although the servers tab might look like it's searching for them). We'll add them in as they become ready. Meanwhile, Marketplace is in the Android, Windows 10 beta, but is yet to be confirmed for the Xbox One beta.\n\n然而，我们并没有把所有的更新计划一起发布出来。服务器还未处于测试阶段（尽管服务器标签看起来像是处于寻找状态）。当它们准备好时，我们会把它们添加进去。与此同时，市场已经进入了安卓平台和Windows 10测试版，但Xbox One测试版的还尚未得到确认。\n\nBut the important thing is that you can still get in on that sweet COARSE DIRT action. Scroll below to see how!\n\n但重要的是，你仍可以在那甜蜜而粗糙的“泥土”上行动。继续往下看吧！\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNew Features: 新特性：\n\nStained Glass 染色玻璃\n\nFireworks (with Elytra boost!) 烟花（和鞘翅搭配效果更佳！）\n\nParrots 鹦鹉\n\nBanners 旗帜\n\nArmor stands 盔甲架\n\nJukebox and music discs 唱片机和音符盒\n\nRecipe Book 合成书\n\nBook and Quill 书与笔\n\nRavines 峡谷\n\nCOARSE DIRT - O to the M G bug\n\nNew world start options: Starting Map, Bonus Chest, Trust Players 新的世界选项：初始地图、奖励箱、玩家信任\n\nNew game rules: TNT Explodes, Natural Regeneration \n新的游戏规则：TNT爆炸、自然回血\n\nAdded '/tickingarea' command to create areas that still update when no players are there\n添加/tickingarea命令，在世界中创造没有玩家时也会自动更新的区域\n\nPlayer permissions 玩家权限\n\nZombie Villager spawn egg 僵尸村民蛋\n\nIn-game host options 游戏主机选项\n\nNew loading screens with funny and helpful tips 现在加载菜单中会有有趣和实用的提示\n\nHow to Play screen 教程菜单\n\nRemix 3D and structure blocks Remix 3D和结构方块\n\nSplit-screen (Console only) 多画面（仅限主机版）\n\nWorld conversion 世界对话\nWe also made loads of tweaks.

There’s so much more, not even including the list of bugs we fixed (such as correctly reorienting the moon). For the full changelog, please visit http://aka.ms/mcchangelogs\n\n我们也在这次更新中做了很多调整。比如：在高端设备上的玩家限制增加了；现在你可以单手拿地图了，冰块现在是透明的，你可以在暂停菜单中改变你的皮肤……还有很多，这些调整甚至不包括我们bug修复列表（比如重新确定月球的位置）。请访问http://aka.ms/mcchangelogs获取完整更新日志。\n\nTweaks 技术性调整\nBlaze Powder is now needed to fuel brewing stands现在需要烈焰粉来作为酿造台的燃料\n\nIce blocks are now transparent\n冰块现在是透明的\n\nMaps can now be held off-hand and show the heads of players' skins\n现在可以单手拿地图，而且地图上会显示玩家皮肤的头部\n\nLocator maps now track the owner's position, regardless of dimension\n定位地图现在会跟踪所有者的位置，无视被跟踪者处于什么世界\n\nWorlds can now be set to Invite Only, Friends Only, or Friends of Friends\n世界现在可以被设置为“只限邀请”、“只限好友”或“好友的好友”\n\nVarious improvements and changes to navigating the user interface\n对用户导航界面进行各种改进\n\nRedesigned button mapping and added Pick Block for controllers\n重新设计界面按钮并未控制器添加Pick Block选项\n\nRender Clouds and Fancy Leaves can now be toggled in Video Settings\n云层渲染和叶子透明选项现可在视频设置中进行更改\n\nSkins can now be changed from the pause menu\n现在可以在暂停菜单中更改皮肤\n\nChat messages can now be muted\n现在可以屏蔽聊天信息了\n\nItems picked up are now animated on the hotbar\n物品在被捡入物品栏热键时会有动画\n\nStained glass and banners will now spawn on End Cities\n现在末影城会出现染色玻璃和旗帜\n\nIncreased the default player limit on worlds from 5 to 8 on higher-end devices\n在高端设备上的游玩玩家数量限制由5提升至8\n\nBlock placement speed now matches the player's movement speed\n方块放置速度会和玩家移动速度相匹配\n\nTemperature decreases with height and it can now snow at high elevations\n温度会随着海拔的升高而降低，现在高海拔地区也会下雪了\n\nObserver blocks have updated textures and will now blink red when outputting a redstone pulse\n修改了观察者方块的材质，现在当观察者方块输出红石信号时会变成红色\n\nAdjusted the color that flashes when mobs are attacked\n调整了怪物在被攻击时闪烁的颜色\n\nBrick Blocks, Nether Brick Blocks, and Clay Blocks have been renamed to better differentiate from other items\n砖块、地狱砖块和黏土块现在被重新命名，以此来和其他物品形成区别\n\nUnderwater particles\n水下粒子\n\nBlock outline selections and Paper Doll can be toggled in the settings\n方块轮廓显示和高亮显示现在可以在设置中切换\n\nBug Fixes bug修复列表（211条）\n\nThe moon is now properly oriented, while the stars correctly traverse the heavens\n\nGhasts will no longer shoot fireballs from farther than they can be seen\n\nFixed missing walking sounds for mobs\n\nArrows now shake upon impact with blocks\n\nPlayers will no longer burn when standing near lava in the Nether\n\nObserver blocks can now detect many more block changes\n\nOptimized chunk generation and loading\n\nThe Lapis Lazuli icon is no longer missing from the Enchantment Table screen\n\nEndermen will now drop the blocks they're carrying when they die\n\nWolves tamed by players not present in a session will no longer change their whole body color\n\nEnd rods now give off light particles\n\nIncreased the strength of the redstone pulse outputted by Observer blocks and they no longer pulse twice when observing a retracting piston\n\nGlazed Terracotta now shows proper colors on maps\n\nDandelions can now be crafted into yellow dye when Pocket UI is enabled\n\nFixed quartz pillars not being craftable using Pocket UI\n\nFixed the level up sound not playing for every five levels gained\n\nOther players should no longer be seen levitating in their sleep\n\nWoodland Mansions will now spawn with birch wood floors instead of oak\n\nWitches will now drink Potion of Fire Resistance when standing on Magma blocks\n\nSounds now play when witches drink potions\n\nSkeletons, Strays, and Zombie Pigmen now have a chance of spawning with enchanted gear and weapons\n\nSkeleton horses can now be saddled\n\nLingering water bottles will now deal damage to Blazes, Endermen, and Snow Golems\n\nOnly one bucket can be placed in a furnace at a time so buckets will no longer be lost\n\nGhast fireballs can now set obsidian on fire and open Nether portals\n\nFixed a crash that could occur when destroying maps\n\nFixed a crash that could occur when the host enters a portal in mutiplayer\n\nEmpty maps can now be combined with a compass on an anvil to create a locator map\n\nFixed the texture of fences in the inventory and in-hand\n\nFishing now uses the proper loot tables to acquire enchanted items and books\n\nThe available enchants on enchantment tables will no longer revert back to the originally available enchants upon world reload\n\nEvokers will no longer attack players on Peaceful difficulty\n\nFixed mobs not attacking Evokers after being attacked by Evokers\n\nThe proper sound now plays when Evokers are transforming blue sheep\n\nMining speed with Haste II and Efficiency V has been increased to its correct speed\n\nSigns can no longer be set on fire\n\nThe snow golem's face can now only be seen once it's sheered.
