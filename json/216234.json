    "txt_content": " 本帖最后由 ilamjan 于 2014-2-28 22:41 编辑 \n\n想制作自己的MOD吗?\n安装本MOD可以比较快速的添加新方块/物品,新的配方,新的熔炉,新的矿物这是我做的方块:\n\n\n\n\n2014-01-10_173315.png (258.35 KB, 下载次数: 214)\n\n下载附件\n\n2014-1-10 17:37 上传\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n这是我做的代码生成界面(呵呵,有点粗糙了)\n\n\n\n\n2014-01-10_173539.png (115.39 KB, 下载次数: 209)\n\n下载附件\n\n2014-1-10 17:39 上传\n\n\n\n\n\n使用说明:\n    第一步: 把Building-Blocks-Mod-Maker-1.6.4.zip文件拖入到mods文件夹里面即可使用,玩家也可以把它解压出来,这样方便上传材质文件.\n    第二步:在.minecraft文件夹下面建立一个bbmm的文件夹,用记事本需要写入的代码写进去,再改名为*.bbmm文件就可以了,然后进入游戏可以看到你的方块了.\n    第三部:写代码,玩家可以用我度娘里的代码生成器来生成代码,把它写进.minecraft\\bbmm\\*.bbmm文件内就行了.\n\n\n提示:一些物品的ID 必须加括号 比如(244:1) 这样\n\n\n这是英文说明书,想看的话也可以,或者是直接用我刚做的代码编辑器就可以了\n || --- Ambiguous Cases --- ||\nSeveral times in this guide, you may see multiple ways of adding new content with different formats.\nThese formats will vary between using a simple ID or a compound (ID:META). These cases are\ninterchangable. For example, you may see a tag for a smelting recipe:smelting, idToBeSmelted, resultId, amount, exp (x.x)\nOR\nsmelting, (idToSmelt:meta), (resultId:meta), amount, exp (x.x)Since the tag is ambiguous, the simple and compound formats may be interchanged, like so:smelting, idToBeSmelted, (resultId:meta), amount, exp (x.x)This will result in a new smelting recipe where a general item can be smelted into a specific item.\nA more real example would be smelting any color wood into brown dye:smelting, 5, (351:3), 1, 30.0That will add a recipe where any of the four logs (oak, birch, jungle, redwood) can be put into a\nfurnace and a brown down will always result. If instead a compound was used (5:0), then only oak\nlogs would work for that recipe.WARNING: Putting a general case for an output ID will always assume the lowest metadata value. Use\nyour judgement when dealing with ambiguous outputs, as if there is metadata involved, it would be\nwise to be specific of what you want.\n|| --- Server Installation --- ||BBMM is possible to install on a server. In order to do so, install forge as you normally would in a\nserver folder. Next, drag this zip into the mods folder and either:\ncreate a new folder titled bbmm\nOR\nrun the server and the directory will be made for youNext, simply drag any mods created through bbmm (that is, the .bbmm files that have been created)\ninto the bbmm folder and then run the server and it will load everything from the file.|| --- Client Installation --- ||BBMM is installed in mostly the same way on the client. Install forge as you would normally and then\ndrag the BBMM zip into the mods folder in .minecraft. Next, either:\ncreate a new folder titled bbmm\nOR\nrun Minecraft and the directory will be made for you|| --- Things to Know --- ||Several times throughout this file, you will see things such as blockID and itemID. These are data\nvalues used by Minecraft to tell the game several different things, such as what a block does when\nit updates, or what an item does when you right click with it. IDs must be unique - a block's ID\ncan not be used by another block or item, and the same goes for items. Item IDs are shifted by 256,\nmeaning that when an item's ID is declared as 5000, it's ID will actually be 5256. So in this\ncontext, if you declare an item using the item creation tag:item, My Item, 5000, myItemand want to use that item in a crafting recipe, you will need to use 5256 instead of 5000:shapeless crafting, 5256-5256-5256, 1, 64That particular shapeless recipe will create 64 stone (stone's ID is 1) blocks from three of the\nitem with ID 5256 (5000+256, or 'My Item').For a full list of IDs that are already being used by Minecraft, go here and click the picture:\nhttp://www.minecraftwiki.net/wiki/Data_valuesIf you find a free ID, you may use it to create a new block or item.|| --- Installing Building Blocks Mods --- ||Installing mods created with Building Blocks is a bit more difficult. Since rendering is done\nclient-side, textures will need to be installed in a different location from the .bbmm file. They\nwill need to be put into a folder called bbmm and armor files go into bbmm/armor, then that should\nbe compressed to a .zip and the zip should be added to the mods folder. The .bbmm file needs to be\nadded to the bbmm folder in .minecraft.The entire BBMM style mod directory should be like this: (This setup sucks, but it's required).minecraft > mods > BBMM vX.Y.Z.zip > assets > bbmm > textures > items > .png files\n.minecraft > mods > BBMM vX.Y.Z.zip > assets > bbmm > textures > blocks > .png files\n.minecraft > mods > BBMM vX.Y.Z.zip > assets > bbmm > textures > armor > .png files\n.minecraft > mods > BBMM vX.Y.Z.zip > assets > bbmm > textures > gui > .png files\n.minecraft > bbmm > .bbmm files\n|| --- A Guide To Making Mods --- ||\n--Block Creation Tags--\nBlocks! Everybody likes new blocks, and knowing that you made one and added it to your game can just\nfeel so rewarding.block, Block Name, blockID, blockMaterial, hardness (x.x), resistance (x.x), light (0.0 to 1.0), texture\naccepted Block Materials: rock, cloth/wool, wood, dirt/ground, iron/metal, glass, leaves\naccepted Light Values: 0.0 to 1.0\noptional parameters: quantity dropped, id dropped\nblock, Block Name, blockID, blockMaterial, hardness (x.x), resistance (x.x), light (0.0 to 1.0), texture, qDrop\nblock, Block Name, blockID, blockMaterial, hardness (x.x), resistance (x.x), light (0.0 to 1.0), texture, qDrop, idDrop\nblock, Block Name, blockID, blockMaterial, hardness (x.x), resistance (x.x), light (0.0 to 1.0), texture, qDrop, (idDrop:meta)\nqDrop is ambiguous. There are two ways to set the quantity drop. To set the drop explicitly,\n  give it a number. To set it randomly in a range, use #r#, where the first # is the\n  minimum, and the second # is the maximum amount.Any of those will work.\n--Ore Dictionary Definition--\nDid you make an ingot or ore that already exists in another mod? More importantly, do you want your\ningot or ore to be useable by that other mod? This tag will allow you to do just that!ore dictionary, id, Name\nore dictionary, (id:meta), NameTry to stick with the conventional names for dictionary users:\nOres are generally oreName\nIngots are usually ingotName\nGems, gemNameYou can't add ore dictionary recipes. Yet. . . (seriously, someone do this so I don't have to)\n--Tool Creation Tags--\nTools are an important part of many mods, and many players love new toolsets. Creating new toolsets\nis simple.tool material, Material Name, harvestLevel, maxUses, efficiency (x.x), damage, enchantabilitytool, Tool Name, itemID, texture, toolType, toolMaterial\naccepted Tool Types: pickaxe, hatchet/axe, hoe, shovel/spade, sword\n--Armor Creation Tags--\nNo good mod would be complete without at least one set of armor! What's the point of digging metal\nout of the ground if you can't wear it?armor material, Material Name, durability, helmReduct, chestReduct, legsReduct, bootsReduct, enchantabilityarmor, Armor Name, itemID, texture, armorType, armorMaterial, armorFile\naccepted Armor Types: helm, chest, legs, bootsNOTE: Creating armor is a bit more extensive. An armor texture must be made and put into the mod's\nassets/bbmm/textures/armor folder labelled either _1 or _2, depending on the type of armor\nHelm, chest and boots require a 1, legs use a 2. The following is an example:armor, Yellow Chestplate, 6000, yellowChestplate, chest, Yellow, yellow\nmods > mybbmm.zip > assets > bbmm > textures > armor > yellow_1.pngThe mod will know automatically where to get all of the proper information to make the item render\nproperly when worn.\n--Generic Item Creation Tags--\nAlmost every mod makes a new item! These tags should help you create some generic items to use in\ncrafting recipes for more functional content.item, Item Name, itemID, texturefood, Item Name, itemID, texture, healthValue, saturation (x.x), canHealWolf (true or false)\n--Crafting Creation Tags---\nCrafting is a HUGE part of Minecraft! Whether it's turning a log into planks or creating a stat-\nboosting Beacon, no mod would be complete without at least one recipe!\n-Shortcut for Tools-\nThese tags are used to create tools using the generic vanilla recipes. It's quicker to use these\nthan using the more specific recipes, unless your tools are crafted in the traditional way.crafting, Tool Name, craftMaterialId, toolType\nOR\ncrafting, Tool Name, (materialID:meta), toolType\naccepted Tool Types: pickaxe, hatchet/axe, hoe, shovel/spade, sword-Completely Configurable Recipes-\nThese tags are used to create specific shaped recipes. Be very careful to make sure it is formatted\nproperly in your files!custom crafting, recipe shape, params, idCrafted, amountCustom Crafting Examples:\nBread\ncustom crafting, 'www', w=296, 297, 1\nBow\ncustom crafting, ' ws'-'w s'-' ws', w=280 s=287, 261, 1\nBlue Wool\ncustom crafting, 'wd', w=35 d=(351:4), (35:11), 1As one can see, the recipe shape can vary in size and shape, just remember to chain the lines\ntogether with hyphens! The recipe params are the values of the items. In the bread example,\nwhere it says w=296, that means the w in the 'www' is itemID 296, which is wheat, and the output\nis 1 bread (297).-Shapeless Crafting-\nShapeless recipes are less common than shaped recipes, but sometimes you just need one!shapeless crafting, params, result, amountShapeless Crafting Examples:\nBook\nshapeless crafting, 334-339-339-339, 340, 1\nRed Wool\nshapeless crafting, 35-(351:1), (35:14), 1\n--World Generation--\nBBMM includes two types of world generation; minables and structures. Minables are just ores than\ncan be found inside of a dimension's stone blocks. Structures are made in-game and then generated\nin new worlds. They are very picky about how they will generate, so don't get discouraged if you\ncan't get it to work.-Minables-worldgen, blockID, minLevel, maxLevel, rarity, veinSize, dimension\nOR\nworldgen, (blockID:meta), minLevel, maxLevel, rarity, veinSize, dimension\naccepted Dimension IDs: -1 (The End - WhiteStone), 0 (Overworld - Stone), 1 (Nether - Netherrack)-Structures-custom gen, genID, min, max, rarity, dimension, otmFile\nOR\ncustom gen, (genID:meta), min, max, rarity, dimension, otmFile//Creating Custom Structure Generation//\n1. Go into creative mode and build a structure, size can be up to 254x254x254\n2. Open the BBMM creative tab and grab the Structure Boundary block and Structure Writer\n3. Put 8 boundaries enclosing the structure in the shape of a cube\nNOTE: Blocks that are in between the boundaries are not counted, only blocks within the boundaries\nFor example, if you put bounds in a 5x5x5 cube, only the 3x3x3 within the box will be counted\n4. Place a data writer inside the boundaries and right click it\n5. A new .otm file will be output to .minecraft/bbmm. You may rename this if you'd like\n6. Use this file name (excluding the .otm extension) in the custom gen creation call\n7. If any of the blocks in the structure is a chest, proceed. Otherwise, you're done!//Chests//\nIn order to generate chest contents, follow these steps\n1. Open the .otm file\n2. After the final line of structure mapping [(data)-(data)-(data)-etc.], use the following tag\nloot, id, number, damage, min chance, max chance, weight\n3. After all of the loot calls, the count of items range must be set using this\nsize, min, max\n4. The final line of the file should say END like it did before.\n5. All chests in the structure will use the same loot parameters\n--Editing Chests in the World--\nYou might just want to have some new incentive to go looking for chests, so why not add some new\nloot into the unknown (ungenerated) world? Or maybe there is already too much?loot add, chestName, id, min, max, weight\nOR\nloot add, chestName, (id:meta), min, max, weightloot remove, chestName, id\nOR\nloot remove, chestName, (id:meta)Any existing items/blocks can be used\nMin is the minimum number, max is maximum (Example, diamond in blacksmith ranges 1 and 3)\nWeight is the likeliness to be chosen (Example, diamond in blacksmith is 3)Chestnames are:mineshaftCorridor\npyramidDesertyChest\npyramidJungleChest\npyramidJungleDispenser\nstrongholdCorridor\nstrongholdLibrary\nstrongholdCrossing\nvillageBlacksmith\nbonusChest\ndungeonChestThese chestNames must be copied exactly, otherwise they will not register correctly\n--Furnace Creation Tags--\nSometimes you need the furnace to work a little more in your favor, and need your new food dish to\nbe cooked before you get food poisoning from eating too much raw food.-Smelting Creation Tags--\nSome mods (especially those involving metal!) need to be able to get their items into a usable\nstate. Sometimes the best way to do that is with a furnace!smelting, idToBeSmelted, resultId, amount, exp (x.x)\nOR\nsmelting, (idToSmelt:meta), (resultId:meta), amount, exp (x.x)-Fuels-\nCoal not cutting it for you? Maybe you need some special fuel to smelt entire stacks before its\nflame finally flickers out.fuel, itemID/blockID, burnTime (measured in ticks)burnTime conversion (use this as a reference for the burnTime math)\n1 smelt = 10 seconds\n10 seconds = 200 ticks\ncoal = 8 smelts = 80 seconds = 1600 ticks, coal burnTime = 1600\n[][]----------------------NEW AND AWESOME FOR BBMM 0.7.7!----------------------[][]--Custom Furnace Creation Tags--\nEven with new fuels and recipes, the furnace STILL isn't cutting it? Do you need a faster furnace?\nMaybe even a SLOWER furnace to cook your food just right? Maybe you need a FREEZER even!-Custom Furnace-\nThis is the epitome of awesome, some of the most epic work ever done with a mod! Next to custom\nstructures, this is will become one of the defining features of Building Blocks!furnace, Furnace Name, blockID, cookTime (x.x), useUniqueRecipes, vanillaFuelCompat, sideTexture, topTexture, frontTextureIdle, fronTextureActive\nFurnace Name is the name that will show up in the inventory and the interface, and is used\n  as the tag for all of this furnace's information.\ncookTime is the amount of seconds it takes for a recipe to finish (vanilla furnace is 10.0)\nuseUniqueRecipes (true/false) is used to determine if this furnace has it's own recipe\n  list. If true, it will not be able to use the recipes that a vanilla furnace uses\nvanillaFuelCompat (true/false) is used to determine if the furnace can use vanilla fuels.\n  This doesn't mean the furnace can't have it's own unique fuels, it is just to say\n  that the furnace will accept any fuel that the vanilla furnace uses along with\n  any unique fuels added belowNOTE: Your GUI texture must be named furnacename.png and should be placed in:\n.minecraft/mods/BBMM vX.Y.Z.zip/assets/bbmm/textures/gui/furnacename.pngIf the gui texture is not there, it will not show up when the furnace is activated!-Fuel Creation Tags-\nfurnace fuel, Furnace Name, id, burnTime\nOR\nfurnace fuel, Furnace Name, (id:meta), burnTimeFurnace name is the tag for which furnace this fuel is used for (see above, this must be\n  typed exactly the same as your custom furnace's name)\nDo not use this if you wish for your fuel to be used by the vanilla furnace, as this is\n  a fuel only usable by your custom furnace-Recipe Creation Tags-\nfurnace recipe, Furnace Name, inputID, outputID, amount, exp\nOR\nfurnace recipe, Furnace Name, (inputID:meta), (outputID:meta), amount, expFurnace name is the tag for which furnace this recipe is used for (see above, this must be\n  typed exactly the same as your custom furnace's name)\nDo not use this if you wish for your recipe to be used by the vanilla furnace, as this is\n  a recipe only usable by your custom furnace\n[][]----------------------NEW AND AWESOME FOR BBMM 0.7.8!----------------------[][]--Metadata and Multi-textured blocks--\nA long awaited feature by many users, multiblocks are a two-in-one block that allows the creation\nof multi-textured blocks that can be added to a single id (max of 16)-Create a new Multiblock-\nUsing this tag will create a 'base' multiblock that new sub-blocks can be appended tomultiblock new, blockID, blockMaterial, hardness (x.x), resistance (x.x), light value (x.x)-Adding Sub-blocks-\nUsing these tags will create new sub-blocks with the metadata value being the lowest one possible.multiblock add, blockIDtoAddTo, Block Name\nThis tag will add a block will all sides of the block textured as blockNamemultiblock add, blockIDtoAddTo, Block Name, textureParams\nThere are two ways to change a block's texture. textureParams can be:\n  all=aTextureName - will retexture all sides of the block to this when called\n  #=aTextureName - will rexture the side of the block to this texture (use 0-5)As an example, one could add new logs like so:multiblock new, 200, wood, 3.0, 4.0, 0.0\nmultiblock add, 200, Willow Log, all=willowSide 0=willowTop 1=willowTop\nmultiblock add, 200, Spruce Log, all=spruceSide 0=spruceTop 1=spruceTopRemember that params are separated by spaces instead of commas\n[][]----------------------NEW AND AWESOME FOR BBMM 0.8.1!----------------------[][]--Records--\nEveryone likes music, but wouldn't it be nice to add some new records to your mod? It's super easy\nto set up!record, itemID, SongName, textureThis tag will create a new record that will play the specified SongName.ogg. SongName and the .ogg\nfilename must match. However, the .ogg file needs to put put in the proper location, which is:\n.minecraft/assets/records\nNOTE: It is respectful to use the Artist of the song in the name of the .ogg and the record. If you\nare adding the song \"Greatest Song Ever\" by John, you should do this:.minecraft/assets/records/John - Greatest Song Ever.ogg\nrecord, itemID, John - Greatest Song Ever, blackRecordIf the 'artist' writes hip-hop or rap music (in which case it is fine to steal credit), disregard\nwhat you just read.[][]----------------------NEW AND AWESOME FOR BBMM 0.8.2!----------------------[][]--Removal--\nPreviously, it was possible to remove recipes, but it never really worked the way it was meant to.\nRecently, a friend of mine decided he wanted the feature remove recipes AND items. I decided to\ngive it another go, and now the feature is implemented and should be here to stay this time!remove, itemIDThis tag removes an item from the game. Be wary, though - removing blocks that are part of world\ngeneration will cause crashes, so make sure you do your research! I am not responsible for any\ndamage done from this tag, it is volatile and should be used if you are sure you know what you're\ndoing.remove recipe, itemID\nOR\nremove recipe, (itemID:meta)This tag will remove a crafting recipe from the recipe list so it will not be craftable. The top\none ignores metadata, so any recipe with that item ID output will be removed. The second one will\nremove only the specific recipe output.Examples:\nremove recipe, 5\nThis will remove all 4 types of planks from being craftableremove recipe, (5:0)\nThis will remove only oak planks from being craftable\n--Vanilla Overrides--\n-------Disabled as of Minecraft 1.6, don't bother with this-------As of BBMM v1.7.5, vanilla item and block textures and names can be overriden using the followingbto, blockID, newTexture\nbno, blockID, newName\nito, itemID, newTexture\nino, itemID, newNam\n\n\n\nbug\n\n代码生成器里的备注功能不能用,请大家不要写备注\n如果代码后面生成了一个 # 符号 ,请自行删除掉\n添加新熔炉如果不成功,就把前面的custom furnace改成furnace\n经过测试,跟CoFHCore-2.0.0.b8a一起安装的话会崩溃.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n这是懒人包地址\nhttp://www.mcbbs.net/thread-217040-1-1.html\n\n\n\n谢谢大家支持~~下面是下载地址已更新 http://pan.baidu.com/s/1mgFNvqK",
