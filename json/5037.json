            "txt_content": "詳情請參考 WIKI 網頁:\nhttp://www.minecraftwiki.net/wiki/Debug_screen\n內容如下, 請自行翻譯吧...\n\nDebug screen\n\nThe debug screen is a screen that is triggered when the F3 key is pressed. It shows the chunk cache, the memory usage, various parameters, the player's map coordinates and a graph that measures latency. It can be very useful for telling other players your map location, checking for lag and various other purposes. \n\nLegend: \nName         Description\nC         Number of chunks rendered over total number of chunks\nF         Number of chunks loaded outside the viewing distance\nO         Number of chunks removed through occlusion culling\nE (first row)         Number of chunks ?\nE (second row)         Number of rendered entities over total entities\nB         Number of entities removed due to hidden chunks\nI         Number of individually removed entities\nP         Particles on screen\nT         Terrain data\nChunkCache         The maximum number of chunks it'll load\n\nBelow these parameters, the player's map coordinates are displayed. The X and Z axis are both horizontal, and the Y axis is vertical.\n\nAt the bottom of the screen, a graph is displayed which measures latency. When you activate the debug screen, it also shows numbers above every mob in the chunk. This is useful for finding mobs to kill. It is often used to find dungeons.\n\nBugs: \n    As of Beta 1.5, the FPS shows the same number as chunk updates. "
