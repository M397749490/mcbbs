Internet and cellphone services run at unbelievably high speeds at relatively low prices. This is all because of everyone's preferred provider: Ulicith. With advances in technology, Ulicith has managed to drop prices far below other providers. They began producing laptops, phones, and tablets, all while monopolizing Shinshi's communications market.   You play as Ji, a resident of Shinshi and customer of Ulicith products. When your laptop experiences some issues, you decide to take it to the Ulicith HQ. Little to your knowledge, it would never get repaired. Instead, you get lost and must find your way out of this immense factory, all while discovering things you were never supposed to see.\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
