    "txt_content": " 本帖最后由 1582952890 于 2017-9-17 08:38 编辑 \n\n\n\nOre Detectors \n{:10_514:}反正我也能猜到你们是不会装进服务器的,所以不翻译了{:10_492:}\n[size=130%]Ore DetectorsAbout time to replace that boring trench-mining with some actual excavation!\n[size=84.6%]Note: This plugin is in alpha - features and behaviors are subject to change.\n\n\n[size=135%]What is OreDetectors?Similar to how real-life metal-detectors work this plugin adds a set of new items to your Minecraft-server: Ore detectors!\n Players will be able to craft these ore-detector items in a workbench, a different one for each ore type, and then while equipped / activated, it will regularly emit sound pulses based on the quantity and distance of matching ore-blocks in a spherical radius around the player.\n Once activated the detector remains active for as long as it remains in the players hotbar - or until manual deactivation or the detector runs out of energy. This enables the player to switch to a pick-axe or other tool while still keeping the detector running.\n[size=120%]Check out the Reviews page for some videos of OD in action!\n\n\n[size=135%]Why add OreDetectors to your server?The goals of OreDetectors:\nTo enrich Minecrafts gameplay with a new balanced mechanic that offer a more rewarding search&explore mining experience that engages the player in the mining process.Transform the dull time sink known as trench-mining from a brain dead stare-at-the-screen-while-holding-left-mouse-button-and-w into actual excavation gameplay that rewards mental effort.Have you ever walked into a mining-trench and thought \"Wow. This place looks really interesting, I think exploring these mine-shafts will be really fun!\" ...not even once right. OreDetectors hopes to encourage players to create a more interesting looking underground world in Minecraft.Reduce the temptation of x-ray cheating by making mining less boring and more engaging (in a non-overpowered way)!\nSounds good? Give OreDetectors a try! :)\n> In early user testing using OreDetectors to find minerals was considered fun/exciting!\n\n[size=135%]Detector RecipesAll detectors are crafted like a plus-sign with a clock at the center. What to put in the remaining four slots depends on what detector you want to make.\nCurrently these detectors exist:Example:Iron detector crafted from iron ore (the block)\nRedstone detector crafted from redstone (the item)\nGold detector crafted from gold ore (the block)\nLapis detector crafted from lapis (the item)\nDiamond detector crafted from diamonds (the item)\nEmerald detector crafted from emeralds (the item)\n\n[size=135%]Features[size=110%] - Current features: \nRepeatedly scans all blocks in a sphere around the players location and calculates an ore-score based on current score-formula*.On each scan the ore-score is displayed and a \"blip\" sound is played based on the score.\"Blip\" intensity and Scan speed increases with increasing score.\n(Think of the motion detectors in Aliens 2!) ;)Range is hard coded: 7 for iron/redstone, 6 for gold/lapis, 5 for diamond/emerald.Separate 'crafting' and 'use' permissions for all detectors! (All allowed by default.)\nPerhaps you want to limit crafting/usage of detectors in some way? Only sell them from shops perhaps?Block searches are performed in the background to avoid server spikes.Adaptive async scheduling delays to minimize computation-to-presentation delay.Partial language support (currently: console messages, activation/deactivation and on/off messages).A player can only have 1 detector active at a time!\n(Activating a second one deactivates the first one.)Toggle the detector by holding it and right-clicking (on a non-interactive block or in the air.)\n(For example: right clicking a door or workbench wont toggle the detector but will just interact with the block normally).Once activated, the detector must remain in the players quickbar to stay active.\n(It can be moved around, but if you move it away from your quickbar the detector will deactivate).McStats support.Detectors have no durability / energy charge in the pre-alpha.Pre-Alpha: There are some minor known issues. (All known issues fixed in v0.0.8!)\n[size=110%] - Planned features: \nOreDetectors fully configurable in their own config file, including ability to add your own custom detectors. (Role-playing in a desert: Water Detector! Mining the depths: Lava Detector! Exploring structures: Trap Detector!)Detectors that react to more than one type of block. (Needed for the examples above.)Energy charge / durability that would require detectors to be recharged / replaced occasionally (perhaps by infusing it with more ore in a workbench / anvil, or charging it for a long time in a furnace). (Configurable!)Detector variations, like varying range, durability, different score formulas* or \"advanced\" detectors with multiple toggleable modes, perhaps by modifying a detector in an workbench / anvil / enchantment-table.Full language support!Admin tools to monitor performance and usage.Auto-update support.Ability to 'Give' an OD to a player via commands. (And an option to turn of crafting.)At some point I might add a \"Find the ores\" mini-game where two or more players or teams of players search identical randomly generated cubes for ore blocks using Ore-Detectors. First one to find all ores win! Might release that as a separate plugin though.(Plugin filename will be normalized once I reach first alpha - OD is still in pre-alpha.)\n[size=84.6%]*Score formulas decides the \"blip\"-behavior of the detectors - i.e. how quantity and distance of ore-blocks affect it.\n\n\n[size=135%]The motivation behind OreDetectorsI've been playing MC for several years and I'm always looking for ways to improve the gameplay without turning it into some kind of boring easy-mode experience. One of the areas that are often overlooked is the actual mining - where players gather the resources needed for the awesome creations they envision and wish to build. How many times has it not happened that the grand vision you had never got finished, or maybe barely even started, because acquiring the required materials was, not too difficult, but rather a task too boring and unengaging. Gathering resources and building up a server economy can be a lot of fun ...I just wish it wasn't such a brain dead task at times.\n\n\n都说这些用不到介绍咯~13楼居然翻译了~Ore Detectors可以让枯燥的挖矿时间变得更有趣\n这个插件在原版的玩法，生物的行为以及游戏的特点上都有变化\nOreDetectors是什么？\n它为原版增加了一套新的系统，你的服务器里将会出现矿物探测机！\n玩家可以在工作台里合成各种矿石的矿物探测仪，然后进行激活，它会基于玩家身边对应矿石的数量和为止来定时发出声音提醒玩家\n一旦探测器开始，他将一直运作，除非玩家手动关闭探测器或探测器能量耗尽，这使得玩家在切换其他工具时探测机也能正常运作\n\n看一看 Reviews page 的评论和录像吧√\n为什么要添加这货到你的服务器呢？\n本插件的目标：\n①为MC提供一种全新的机制来丰富玩家在挖矿过程中的体验\n②Transform the dull time sink known as trench-mining from a brain dead stare-at-the-screen-while-holding-left-mouse-button-and-w into actual excavation gameplay that rewards mental effort.（译者注：这是国外的一个哏。反正我们看不懂就不翻译了）\n③你是否从未有过：“WOW！这个地方真的很有趣！我想探索这个地方也是很有趣的”的感觉呢？本插件鼓励玩家在底下的MC世界里获得更多的快乐\n④通过这种鼓励的方式来减少玩家利用MOD的作弊（译者注：我觉得这个才是最重要的功能）\n听起来不错吧（译者:不错你妹啊）? 那就快点试试看吧! :)\n> 玩家在早期利用这个小玩意发现更多的矿物是会觉得很有趣的√（译者:只有早期么....）\n合成方法:中间放一个钟，其他四面（上下左右）放矿物的掉落物\nIron detector crafted from iron ore (the block)\nRedstone detector crafted from redstone (the item)\nGold detector crafted from gold ore (the block)\nLapis detector crafted from lapis (the item)\nDiamond detector crafted from diamonds (the item)\nEmerald detector crafted from emeralds (the item)\n（译者:就是放所需矿石的掉落物...没烧过的那种....铁探测器则放铁矿石,红石探测器则放红石，钻石放钻石，金子放金矿）\nOreDetectors的工作方式和特性\n根据玩家玩家反复扫描周围的矿物分布，然后发出“昙花一现”的声音（什么鬼）来提示玩家\n玩家默认有制造和使用的权限\n也许你想限制全新？或只让商店出售？（笑，那是不可能的）\n矿石探测是按区块进行，避免服务器卡顿\n部分语言文件支持（就是不能100%语言文件汉化，内核可以）\n玩家同时只能使用一种探测仪（激活第二种则会自动关闭第一种）\n当玩家与方块或门交互时，会关闭探测仪（就是拿着探测仪开门关门什么的）\nMcStats 支持\n阿尔法版本及之前是没有能量限制的\n在阿尔法版本有很多BUG，已全部在v0.0.8版本修复（译者:老是提阿尔法版本干嘛）\nOreDetectors的未来计划\n玩家可自定义的配置文件（根据不同环境和自定义探测仪的使用方法和规则)\n更好的充能系统（利用铁毡，工作台等充能）（译者:卧槽）\n可修改的探测公式\n完整的语言文件支持\n可直接给予玩家一种探测仪\n自动更新支持\n更好的管理方案和性能监视\n一种探矿的小游戏（不过可能会用一款新插件来实现完整的功能）\n作者的话\n看原文吧= =\nThe motivation behind OreDetectorsI've been playing MC for several years and I'm always looking for ways to improve the gameplay without turning it into some kind of boring easy-mode experience.
