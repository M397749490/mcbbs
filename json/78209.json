I was originally hoping\nto work on another project but later realized I wasn't ready for it, nor\nin the mood.  The ideas for this project came and sparked my interests, which\nI'm happy for.  The map in no way displays the ideas I had 100%, and is in no way\neverything that I hope for it to be, because there are some steep paths I\ncould have taken this project in.  Though I have much more dedication for my\nother projects that are still in the works, and so I did not want to\ntake this project deeper than needed.  I'm happy to share it now, despite those little\nthings, and I hope that it provides some source of fun for people to enjoy.\n\n(转载)Tartaros\n\n\n\n\n185119333k3fcfe3d3ec30.jpg (28.66 KB, 下载次数: 4)\n\n下载附件\n\n2013-1-15 19:04 上传\n\n\n\n\n\nCompletely solo project. I built this to be an adventure map, but I didn’t invest enough time to finish interiors and to add mob spawners and loot (IRL and Starcraft took me away). I plan to continue working on interiors and will eventually update, almost certainly when the contest is over.\n(转载)哈克殖民地\n\n\n\n\n184659zxbbejr6tg1ugggg.jpg (43.1 KB, 下载次数: 2)\n\n下载附件\n\n2013-1-15 19:05 上传\n\n\n\n\n\nI uploaded image of this universe, which I created some months ago, and I'm still doing it - civilizations, physics and chemistry of this universe, planets, solar systems etc.\nAs you can see there is text in another language - Polish - but I explained nearly the same things up there, in the Story.\nI'll end this project after the contest. Thanks for reading, I hope you understood what I wrote.\nThank you, Grery.\n(转载)阿斯特里亚的深渊\n\n\n\n\n161118gqkr6ud85kieggn3.jpg (33.6 KB, 下载次数: 0)\n\n下载附件\n\n2013-1-15 19:04 上传\n\n\n\n\n\nI started this project the day I saw the contest opening and spent about 5 days terraforming. It was an experience for me and my first real terraforming project. After seeing the competition I lost all my motivation and quit. Not seeing the purpose in continuing any further. I recently came in contact with djpaulii and old acquaintance of mine and we decided to collab on a build which will soon be released on a new account specifically for our 2 person build team. After showing him my cave he motivated me to finish and helped me fill it with builds and plantation.\n(转载)仓井，流放市\n\n\n\n\n160345rrr1f1flns31fffn.jpg (36.84 KB, 下载次数: 0)\n\n下载附件\n\n2013-1-15 19:04 上传\n\n\n\n\n\nThanks LastGhost for the banner, absolutely amazing!\n(转载)E.E编年史\n\n\n\n\n155924yddj8yqqvyql2rdj.jpg (26.64 KB, 下载次数: 0)\n\n下载附件\n\n2013-1-15 19:04 上传\n\n\n\n\n\n Long story short I basically learned of the contest at around the 20th of December so I joined in and started quite late, but yeah...I'm quite fond of post war/apocalyptic or anything that's based on ruins so I decided to go with the \"Long Lost Ruins\" genre and tried my best, as I didn't have much time I couldn't go as big as I planned for nor as complex with the redstone wiring nor the actual quest/goal or combat mechanics so I suggest you play on peaceful but on survival mode or adventure...also do note that the map is mostly interactive and puzzle-based with little to no clues....but they're pretty easy and common-sense-ish! ... oh and there may be some traps here and there!\n(转载)圣殿的守护者\n\n\n\n\n155453sxwg3fxjkgw61sqg.jpg (38.37 KB, 下载次数: 0)\n\n下载附件\n\n2013-1-15 19:04 上传\n\n\n\n\n\nNothing like a last minute entry! We at ChunkyCraft have worked really hard to be able to get this build done in time and we hope you all appreciate the work we put into it.
