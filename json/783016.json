It is the first release to use a common codebase for every minecraft version. Internally, UniversalModCore allows the same code to run on ANY version of minecraft that it's been ported to. This means that adding features to Immersive Railroading are completely decoupled from the idiosyncrasies of each minecraft version and development can happen much faster and with less backporting issues.New Additions:* Added Track Exchanger Tool @FriedrichLP* New sw1500 Textures from @WrongWeekend* New wrench from @FriedrichLP and @Thelegend5550* Resources to run IR reduced (render to 2d icons during init)* New config UI (see keybindings)* Track preview rendered in blueprint toolImprovements:* 2d icons (generated in 3d) now used by default! This drastically reduces GPU requirements for IR* Texture loading system improved to unload textures not in view. This also drastically reduces requirements.* Chuffing is now quieter when the throttle is set to 0* Support larger # of components (smoke/wheels/pistons/etc...)* Handcar now uses saturationBug fixes:* Fixed inventory randomly eating items* Fixed a few null pointer exceptions in the track system* Fixed deep snow crashing the game\n1.6.1-(1.12_1.11_1.10)Release Notes:* Add support for ComputerCraft!* Fix long smooth track placement rendering weird* Fix neverending bell when locomotives broken\n1.6.0-(1.12_1.11_1.10)Release Notes:In celebration of the Union Pacific firing up 4014 in preparation for her inaugural run, we have included an update for the Big Boy in Immersive Railroading.\nNew Features:* Add Radio Control card for OpenComputers - Endal* Support for multiple track models - cam72cam- New track models - Thelegend5550- Custom costs for different track models - cam72cam* Switch toggle item (hammer) - tigerbird1 - Model by Thomas4Peyton* Tooltips for stock creater info - DarkRaider* Paintbrush text feedback - DarkRaider* Add showCurrentLoadOnly for modelers - Endal* Add scroll bar to casting item picker - Endal* Config option to restrict stock to gauges (off by default) - Endal* Add bell and sustained horn - Digital Magic* Custom pick block for bed and fill - cam72cam- put track blueprint in offhand and attack / use to set* Add memory debug info - cam72cam\nUpdates:* Enable texture scaling by default - cam72cam* Update CN translations - TartaricAcid* Update japanese translation - gaojie429* Update BigBoy model - TheLegend5550* Update A5, Iron Duke, Firefly - Thelegend5550* Update RS-1 - WrongWeekend* Correct RS-1 weight - WrongWeekend* Rewrite GPU rendering to use VBO's more efficiently - cam72cam* Optimize render preview - cam72cam* Updated Caboose - TheLegend5550\nBugfixes:* Fix railbed placements - Brendan* Previews don't shift+break if you don't have materials - cam72cam* Overhaul overlapped track following - cam72cam* Fix overlapped switches - cam72cam* Fix mallet rear wheel rotation code - cam72cam* Fix SingularMatrixException - cam72cam* Fix dieselfuels overwritten - cam72cam* Fix crash during resource pack reload - cam72cam* Fix JER crash - cam72cam* Fix infinite pour in basin - cam72cam* Fix infinite steel in basin - cam72cam* Fix snow layers render - cam72cam* Fix rail item render - cam72cam* Fix _variants for stock models - cam72cam1.5.0-(1.12_1.11_1.10)New Contributors:- Benjamin Plain (bplainia)- Jacob Hayes (tigerbird1)- Mason Besmer (HealthCareUSA)\nTrack Rewrite:- Add Golden Spike for dynamic changes to blueprints (model from @WrongWeekend)- Support for custom track bezier/cubic curves- Support for tracks up to 1KM in length- Switches can now be adjusted in blueprint mode to use custom curves- Tracks can now overlap in almost any orientation- Increase area switches can accept redstone- New config setting: oldNarrowWidth (width of narrow gauge tracks has changed)- Speed up track render 6x- Fix bogies and front locomotive following tracks\nNew Features:- Updated OC Consist info get to include more detail - @HealthCareUSA- Add computer mode to detector to not output redstone- 2D Icon Cache is much more efficient and detailed- New config setting for detail of 2D icon cache (iconCacheSize)\nModels:- C44-9CW Texture Upgrade - @Thelegend5550\nBugfixes:- Fix 1% cargo load always showing - @FriedrichLP- Fix recipe file names swapped - @tigerbird1- Fix #504: Prevent coupling sound when couplers are not engaged- Safer World.MAX_ENTITY_RADIUS override- Fix #475: Prevent NaN in loco augment (default 0)\n1.4.1-(1.12_1.11_1.10)Fixes:* Using the blueprint book no longer crashes when used to view/place a multiblock\nImprovements:* Users on servers will stay riding their trains when relogged (does not persist over server restarts!)* Better tickskew code\n1.4.0-(1.12_1.11_1.10)Updated Models:* A1 Peppercorn and Tender (2 paint shemes) - @Legend5550* BR Coach (2 paint schemes) - @Legend5550* E6 Atlantic - @Legend5550* A few other pieces of rolling stock - @Legend5550 + @KreigfoxFeatures:* Ability to have different paint schemes for locomotives/stock (A1 Peppercorn, BR Coaches).
