(Dang)\n\n(Don't mine at night ) \nI know your lookin' at that cave\nAnd your feelin' kinda' brave. \nGo to bed you'll be alright \n\n(Don't mine at night) \nThere's nothing that is gonna' change\nIf you just wait until the day  \nZombie wanna' eat your brains\n\n(Don't mine at night)\nI know it's me your gonna' thank\nMake a bed it's not too late\n3 wool and 3 wooden planks\n\n(Don't mine at night)\nHow many times I have to say\nDrop the pick and walk away-a\nWoah\n\nDon't mine at night\n(don't mine at night )\nDon't mine at night \n(don't mine at night)\n\nStomach's all tied up in knots\nThis labyrinth, I'm gettin' lost\nThis is really gettin' old \nFound like 2 pieces of coal\n\nDown one way there's just stone\nMonsters won't leave me alone\nDown another there's some lava \nAnd of course I get, PWND \n\nRemember last time I tried to mine at night\nI failed, so bad\n\nI lost all my stuff\nIt was really tough\nThat's it (RAGE QUIT!)\n\n(Don't mine at night ) \nI know your lookin' at that cave\nAnd your feelin' kinda' brave. \nGo to bed you'll be alright \n\n(Don't mine at night) \nThere's nothing that is gonna' change\nIf you just wait until the day  \nZombie wanna' eat your brains\n\n(Don't mine at night)\nI know it's me your gonna' thank\nMake a bed it's not too late\n3 wool and 3 wooden planks\n\n(Don't mine at night)\nHow many times I have to say\nDrop the pick and walk away-a\nWoah\n\nDon't mine at night\n(don't mine at night )\nDon't mine at night \n(don't mine at night)\n\nD-O-N-T   M-I-N-E  x4",
