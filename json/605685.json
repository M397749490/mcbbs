But I had just started to making the map 1 week before the deadline of the competition! I think this map must have tonnes of bugs. So I say sorry to you guys on here first.\n\n\nThe Screenshot\n\n ^ Lobby of the minigame\n\n ^ The sign for join the game\n\n ^ Playfield of the minigame\n\n ^ The sand will drop down from the sky to the playfield\n\n ^ The mechanism of the minigame\n\n ^ the ramdomizer of the puzzle\n\n ^ I also leave the puzzle customizer for you to design you own puzzle!\n\n\nDownload the Game\nBaidu: http://pan.baidu.com/s/1eSyRtke (Password: xdiu)\n\n\nBy Jason Kwok",

Just as an example, it's \"don't GET stuck in the sand\" instead of what you wrote. In English we don't use adjectives as verbs, my dear fellow native Chinese speaker.\n\nOk, so here's the deal. Unless you are absolutely confident with your English and has a means of proving it, such as a TOEFL 116/120 or whatnot (which happens to be my score by the way), maybe you should seriously consider the possibility that instead of making you sound smart and intelligible, speaking a language out of appropriate context makes you sound awkward and dumb instead. Not to mention this whole pile of mistakes you have in there.\n\nWell, if you still insist using this unfamiliar language after all this explanation, can you PLEASE proof read your post as it is filled with excessive and/or inappropriate usage of words, apart from the already overwhelming number of grammar mistakes."
