I've looked through the code changes several times and have determined that if this mod is to continue, it would likely require a complete rewrite of major portions of code. This is assuming every feature is able to be ported, which I cannot guarantee.\n\nDue to these circumstances, I currently have no plans on porting the mod to Minecraft 1.8. If you have suggestions on how to move forward, or would like to help, feel free to drop by the mod thread and post your idea(s).复制代码"
