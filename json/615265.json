Welcome\nEver wanted to make money while you are sitting in front of your PC, playing Minecraft, being 100% naked and eating doritos? So this is the place for you. The list above contains many different ways of making money with Minecraft, including easy ways and difficult ways, it is up to you to choose which way you want to start. And the most important thing is: you must have a PayPal and do not do anything that breaks the law.\n\nHave a nice day! And I wish you all success :)\nII. Ways of making money with Minecraft1. Shorten Links ( Not Really Recommend )\n\nOk, so this way of making money is very simple and it will earn you some money from almost everything you make with Minecraft.\n\n( I don't say you will become super rich with this method, but it is a safe and reliable source of money income. )\n\nSo you start with this method by making a Minecraft map, mod, resource pack, or just some things that are about Minecraft and you post on some Minecraft famous forums like:\n\n                                                http://www.minecraftforum.net\n                                                 http://www.planetminecraft.com\nIn my opinion, these websites are actually the best place for you to post your own projects which about Minecraft. And after you post your project there, you should add your download links using some shorten link website. These shorten link websites will pay you for every single person that use the link which you shortened.\nSo here are the best shorten link websites according to my opinion:\n\nA. AdFoc.ushttps://adfoc.us/\nI personally recommend using AdFoc.us because this website will offer you $6.70 / 1000 views which  is the highest offer now. And their advertisements are absolutely not pop-up so your downloaders don't have to worry about virus or spams.\nB. adf.lyhttp://adf.ly/\nThis site offer you $5 / 1000 views which is a very nice offer too. And most people use this site because Ad Block doesn't work on this site so you are sure to make money with this site. If you want to be 100% sure that you make money, I recommend you use this website.\n\n2. Ask For Donation ( Recommend )\n\nSo if you read the headline, probably you will think \" Uh, hey dude! R u kidding us? Nobody will donate. They just want to download for free! \"\nAnd here is my reply: \" Yub, most people do so. But some will donate you some money if your work is really work and useful for them. Trust me! \"\nSo here is some ways of doing this method:\n\nA. Donation With PayPal\n\n\nSo after you post your project ( maps, mods, resource pack, ... ) on a Minecraft Forum, you should add a Support Section which include the Donate Button or some where to donate for you. You should do some Google Search on how to do so.\n\nB. PatreonThis way of making money don't require your work to have the best quality but this requires you to upload some things new very often since with this method, you are paid with every single thing that you make. So, first make some \" killer \" projects that everyone loves and then ask for someone to become a Patreon for you. They will pay you automaticly whenever you upload some thing.\n\n\n3. Coding\nWhen I say about this type of making money, many people immediately think about Minecraft modding. But no, never try to sell your mods because there are many different mods out there and the percent that you get your mods to be sold is actually very low.\nBut what I am talking about in this Coding section is Bukkit Plugins\nSo some of you my don't know what Bukkit is. You can do some Google Search for more detail. But I will talk about it in short. Bukkit plugins are actually mods for Minecraft Server, and many servers will offer you tons of money if you can make a unique plugin for them from a simple Economy system to a complex one like minigames.\nAll you need to know in order to make these Plugins is some knowledge on Java Coding Language and then search Youtube for some Bukkit Developer Guide.\nAlthough this way of making money can make you rich but it's quite hard for almost everybody to make their own plugin.\n\n4. Youtube\n\nSo this is actually a really fun way to make money with Minecraft. You can upload game play videos, house and redstone building tutorials, ... And once you get quite popular ( about 1000 subs is Ok ) you can use Google Adsense to have money from your videos, the more views you get, the more money you can make.\nIf you use Google AdSense, you are actually making money by putting advertisements into your videos. You don't need to worry about annoying advertisements or spams since these advertisements are from Google so they are completely safe to use.\n\n5. Server\nA. Making your own Server\n\nSo this way will cause you money and time. But if you are good at building and managing, so this is the right method for you. After finished building your server and added every thing it needs to become a good server, just add donation for your server ( my friends have a 40 player slots server and he makes about 60 $ every month, he only need 10 $ to host his server. ) or you can even add perks to your server and then sale them. The more expensive the perk is, the more permission they will get.\nBut I am absolutely sure that you will make money with this way.\n\nB. Become a Server Staff\nSo you are very good at building, managing or coding Bukkit Plugins but you can't afford to make your own Minecraft server? So you should look for a newly create server ( these servers usually need staff since they  are newly created ) and ask if you looking for staffs. If they need staffs, prove yourself that you  are useful by giving them some informations about yourself and if you are a builder, send them an image about what you have done in Minecraft. And if they accept you, here come the money .\nIII. The End\nIn conclusion, you can use any ways of making money from above to make money, you can even think an unique one. I hope you best luck and make a lot of money.\nGood bye! And have a nice day!\n\n",
