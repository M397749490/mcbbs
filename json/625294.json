All of that that goes down the drain when the ever \nimpending doom on the apocalypse is heavy on the shoulders of the people \nvacationing there. Hesitant, people attempt to leave but the disease strikes to quickly. \nDooming all the inhabitants turning them into the undead. Some would argue that \nthe island is more beautiful than it was when it was still inhabited by the living because \nof the overgrowth of greenery. \n\nGameplay \nExplore the overgrown structures taken back by nature, Take a long stroll down the \ngrassy asphalt streets and climb to the tallest points to experience the island from the sky. \n\nMan Hours \nThis map took more than 170+ hours to build and terraform. Blood sweat and tears went into this map \nand I really hope you enjoy it. It took me longer than I hoped it would take to finish this map but it's finally \nfinished and I'm super pleased with where it's at. \n\nCrafting Dead WIP \n\nThis map was built in 1.7.10 - 1.8 so it's now being changed to the current version of Crafting dead Cure.\n\n请对原作者的话进行完整翻译。"
