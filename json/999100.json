    "txt_content": "如题\n这是配置文件，求大佬帮忙看一下！！\nPermissions:\n  # By default \"libsdisguises.disguise.cow\" will allow all options for cow disguise unless another permission has\n  # defined otherwise.\n  # If given \"libsdisguises.disguise.animals.setburning\" then \"libsdisguises.disguise.cow\" they will still be able to\n  # use other options like \"setbaby\". This was provided for backwards compatibility.\n  # By turning this from 'false' to 'true' the plugin will no longer give them the options unless the player was\n  # explicitly granted it. Even if by wildcard. The above example means they can only use \"setburning\"\n\n  # To summarize, \"libsdisguises.disguise.cow\" will no longer let them do any options on the cow disguise unless it\n  # was added to their permissions\n\n  # You can read more about permissions here: https://www.spigotmc.org/wiki/lib-s-disguises-setting-up-permissions/\n  # The permission used to check OPs who may not have permissions defined, is \"libsdisguises.*.*.*\" which you can\n  # negate with your permissions plugin\n  ExplicitDisguises: false\n\n# Disables commands with the exception of /libsdisguises. Useful if you don't want the plugin to be used by anything\n#  but a plugin\n# Useful if you didn't purchase the plugin.\nDisableCommands: false\n\n# The disguise plugin stores all GameProfiles inside a folder called \"GameProfiles\" as a local cache\n# This means that the plugin doesn't need to constantly call Mojang just to find a skin for an offline player\n# However some people may prefer to disable this.\n# Even if you disable this, if there was disguises in the cache already then it will use them\nSaveGameProfiles: true\n\n# This option is useless if you don't enable SaveGameProfiles!\n# If a player has been disguised before and their skin saved into the cache\n# When they join the server will automatically update the cache in case they changed their skin\nUpdateGameProfiles: true\n\n# THIS IS A PREMIUM ONLY FEATURE. TO USE IT, PURCHASE THE PLUGIN.\n# Saves disguises so that they persist after server shutdown, chunks unload, player logouts and so on.\n# As such, this completely replaces the KeepDisguises aspect which has been removed except for the player death.\n# Players - Are player disguises saved\n# Entities - Are entities disguises saved (This is everything that's not a player)\n# If you are using the dev builds, place your premium version of Lib's Disguises.jar inside the LibsDisguises folder\n# This will enable premium only features for the dev builds.\n# The saved disguises are saved in a json file format inside the plugin folder, there will be no other formats\nSaveDisguises:\n  Players: false\n  Entities: false\n\n# Do names go beyond the 16 char limit for player disguises?\nExtendedNames: true\n\n# Does the player keep their disguise after they die?\nKeepDisguises:\n  PlayerDeath: false\n\n# Should the plugin use translations? Note that a player must see the message before it will appear in translations.yml\nTranslations: false\n\n# How should the plugin handle self disguises scoreboards? It disables pushing in whichever team they're assigned.\n# If you want them to be able to push again when they undisguise, set this to CREATE_SCOREBOARD\n# I have to disable pushing or you will be pushed around by your own self disguise\n# MODIFY_SCOREBOARD - Modifies the player's current team if possible, otherwise assigns them to a new scoreboard team.\n# IGNORE_SCOREBOARD - Doesn't touch scoreboards at all, effectively means that if you didn't disable pushing in their scoreboard team; They will still be pushed around\n# CREATE_SCOREBOARD - Creates a new team which copies the attributes of their previous scoreboard team which they are then assigned to. This means they keep nametag color and other options.\nSelfDisguisesScoreboard: MODIFY_SCOREBOARD\n\n# More options in case you want to disable a specific setting of the scoreboard\nScoreboard:\n  # Should it modify the scoreboard to turn collisions off?\n  Collisions: true\n  # Should it modify the scoreboard teams to disable seeing friendly invisibles?\n  DisableFriendlyInvisibles: true\n  # Should the scoreboard warn you if it detects a potential conflict?\n  # If self disguises are disabled, or the scoreboard is using IGNORE_SCOREBOARD then this does nothing.\n  WarnConflict: true\n\n# Shall I notify those with the correct permission when there's a LibsDisguises update?\nNotifyUpdate: true\n\n# Whats the permission to get the notification?\nPermission: 'libsdisguises.update'\n\n# Where should the plugin check for updates?\n# SAME_BUILDS - Will check snapshots if you're not using a release build\n# RELEASES - Only check for actual releases\n# SNAPSHOTS - Only check for new snapshots\nUpdatesBranch: SAME_BUILDS\n\n# Whats the max size allowed for command disguiseradius\nDisguiseRadiusMax: 50\n\n# Whats the max size allowed for command undisguiseradius\nUndisguiseRadiusMax: 50\n\n# Shall the players view their disguises?\n# Best used when viewing yourself in 3rd person\nViewSelfDisguises: true\n\n# Shall I disguise the sounds?\n# This turns your damage sound into a MOOOO\nDisguiseSounds: true\n\n# Shall the disguised hear their disguise sounds or their damage sounds.\n# I disable this as it can be a little confusing when not used with self disguises\nHearSelfDisguise: true\n\n# When disguised, should a message be displayed to the player in action bar?\n# The message can be customized in translations\nNotifyPlayerDisguised: true\n\n# Shall I send the velocity packets?

The client automatically assumes it was successful and displays the sheep's wool or the wolfs collar as dyed.\n# This is a option that either prevents that happening, or it changes their color officially in the plugin so that everyone sees it changed.\n# Its currently set to false which means that the color is not changed and will refresh itself to the player.\n# Please note that this will not remove the dye from their hands. This also does not check if the disguised entity is actually a sheep/wolf and wants a say in its color.\nDyeableSheep: false\nDyeableWolf: false\nDyeableCat: false\n# Can a player interact with a llama with carpet to set or change their carpet color?\nCarpetableLlama: false\n# Can a player interact with a non-saddled horse of any type, to give it a saddle?\n# This does not change what you can ride or control!\nSaddleableHorse: false\n\n# This is only called into action when the disguise is constructed using the commands.\n# And when the disguise supports that. This will not be used at all for plugins constructing the disguises for instance.\n# Such as prophunt. Its also false because its kind of a retarded feature.\n# This is pretty simple. It shows the players displayname (Name as it appears in chat) above their head.\n# This also overrides any custom name they have set in their disguise options.\n# This does not take effect on player disguises\n# Permission to disable is libsdisguises.disablename\nShowNamesAboveDisguises: false\n\n# This supports the above option.\n# If this is true, then the name shown above the head appears regardless of if you are looking at the disguise directly or not.\nNameAboveHeadAlwaysVisible: true\n\n# This modifies the bounding box, This is stuff like can a arrow hit them.\n# If you turn this to true, arrows will act like they hit the disguise in the right place!\n# Clients will not see any difference in the hitboxes they are attacking, this is a server-sided calculation!\n# So someone disguised as a enderdragon will easily get shot down by arrows!\n# This WILL conflict with NoCheatPlus. Other plugins may also get problems.\n# This shouldn't really be enabled for players as it also interferes with their movement because the server thinks\n# the player is larger than they really are.\n# That makes the player unable to approach this building because the server thinks they are trying to glitch inside\n# blocks.\n# This feature is highly experimental and is guaranteed to cause problems for players who are disguised\nModifyBoundingBox: false\n\n# This prevents disguised players from being targeted by monsters.\n# This doesn't prevent their targeting you if already targeting when disguised\n# They will just ignore you unless provoked.\nMonstersIgnoreDisguises: false\n\n# This works only for players, disguised monsters and the like will not be undisguised\n# Should the player's disguises be removed if they attacks something?\n# Blown Disguise message can be changed in translations\n# Message can be hidden with an empty translation\nBlowDisguisesWhenAttacking: false\n\n# Should the player's disguises be removed if they're attacked by something?\nBlowDisguisesWhenAttacked: false\n\n# Should PvP be disabled when disguised?\nDisablePvP: false\n# Should PvE be disabled when disguised?

Disabling this option will disable player skin disguises!\nContactMojangServers: true\n\n# Hide players in tab when disguised? This means a disguised player cannot be seen when you press tab!

People will crash\n  Animation: true\n  # This disguises the collect packet. If a living entity disguised as a non-living entity picks up a item. People will crash. This fixes it\n  # This also fixes people crashing if a item disguised as a sleeping player is picked up - Only true if Bed is enabled as well\n  Collect: true\n  # This disables a fix for when a disguised entity wearing armor dies, if the disguise can wear armor. It drops unpickupable items to anyone watching.\n  EntityStatus: true\n  # Entity equipment is the packets that are sent to ensure that a disguise has or doesn't have armor, and their held item.\n  # Disabling this means that any disguises which can wear armor or hold items will show the armor/held item that the disguised is wearing.\n  Equipment: true\n  # This doesn't actually disable the packet. It would introduce problems. Instead it does the next best thing and caches the data.\n  # This means that entity metadata will not change, and will only be sent in the spawn packet.\n  # This is good if performance is extremely in need.\n  # This is bad to disable unless you are ONLY going to use the disguises for decorations.\n  # To be honest. This is basically \"Disable entity animations\". That option is called 'AddEntityAnimations' in the config but unlike that, this is always in effect.\n  # Animations set by use of the api or through the disguise command are still in effect.\n  Metadata: true\n  # Movement packets are the biggest cpu hit. These are majorly used to ensure that the disguises facing direction isn't bugged up.\n  # If you are using the Item_Frame disguise, when a packet is sent (Roughly every 2min) the disguise will bug up until they move.\n  Movement: true\n  # Disable this if you don't mind crashing everytime you see someone riding something disguised as a non-living entity\n  Riding: true\n  # When disguised as a wither skull, it sends a look packet every tick so that the wither skull is facing the right way.\n  WitherSkull: true\n\n# Added to support a Chinese Minecraft Server which uses their own skin server unless the UUID is not version 4.\n# Changing this from 4 to say, 3.
