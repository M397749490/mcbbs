As always, please remember to backup your servers before updating, just in case. As this is our first 1.2 Recommended Build, updating is highly recommended.\n\nWill plugins break with this build?\nUnless the plugin developers of your plugins have been keeping up with Bukkit development, plugins will most likely be broken due to the recent optimisation and cleaning of our code. However, if the plugins you use have already been updated to work with at least 1.1-R7 or 1.2.3-R0.1, then you should be fine.\n\n提供1.2.4稳定兼容与一堆BUG修复，建议更新\n如果你的插件已经做好了对1.1-R7或1.2.3-R0.1的兼容，那么也可以兼容1.2.4-R1.0。\n\n下载地址http://dl.bukkit.org/\n\n",
