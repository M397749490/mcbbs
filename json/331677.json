This pack includes 2 popular mods that makes the game hard: TerrafirmaCraft and Minecraft-is-too-Easy. Some of you may heard of GregTech, but it is not included in this pack yet. The basic mods are based on my Mix Mod Pack, which is 1.4 version, deleted TukMc.\nIntro to TerraFirmaCraft\nTerrafirmacraft is a mod that changes many of the game's features, makes it realer(and harder). You no longer have \"Steve's Fists\" that can chop down trees barehanded... However, making stone tools is much easier. Cut stones to get stone axes. You can do that if you have at least 2 stones in a stack:\n\n\n\n\n2014-08-28_17.43.09.png (95.38 KB, 下载次数: 84)\n\n下载附件\n\n2014-8-29 09:31 上传\n\n\n\n\n\nWell, look at the yellow flowers in the background. Are they really cute? If you find some, you're lucky. Maybe you can cut them off and show them to your friends? Ahh, joking. These flowers only grows on clay. What clay can be used? Stained clay? Bricks? Well, these in TFC are disabled. Instead, guess what? There're jugs what that you can drink water to increase the value of thirst(which is also added in this mod). The jug has a approx. 20% chance for breaking each use, so bring at least two in your adventure. Vessels made of clay are also a nice tool to use, it can store food and their decay(Yes, DECAY) rate will be cut in half. It can't store larger items. It's also required to smelt copper ores(or bronze, alloy with some other metals). Naturally generated clay looks like this:\n\n\n\n\n2014-08-28_17.43.58.png (300.03 KB, 下载次数: 87)\n\n下载附件\n\n2014-8-29 09:39 上传\n\n\n\n\n\nIt also drops less than in vanilla and mines slower. when you break the clay under the new flower, it won't drop. Nice for psychopathic people XD!\nOnce metal tool was made, they lasts long. Copper tools lasts about 650 uses, and bronze tools are over 1000. Don't worry your tool will run out too fast.\nThere are several variable of metal tool types: Pickaxe, Axe, Shovel, Sword, Hoe, Prospector's Pick, Hammer, War Hammer, Skythe, Chisel, Saw, Javelin, and Knife. The ExtraFirma Addon in this mod pack also adds two new types of weapon. The recommended way obtaining these items:\nIf you want a fast game -> Saw-Pickaxe-ProPick-Hammer-Chisel-Hoe-Skythe-Sword-Axe-WarHammer-Shovel.\nIf you want a safe game -> Pickaxe-Saw-Sword-ProPick-Axe-WarHammer-Chisel-Hammer-Skythe-Hoe-Shovel.\nIf you want a balance -> Pickaxe-Saw-ProPick-Hammer-Sword-Chisel-Skythe-Axe-WarHammer-Hoe-Shovel.\nNote that shovel is always at last, because they're much more useless than other tools. Some tools are MORE useless, such as Javelin, breaking too fast while fighting enemies. Knives are more useless-They breaks only a bit more slower than stone knives-and deals a bit more damage. A new weapon in ExtraFirma increases your range, which is really useful when hunting spiders and bears. Bears are a new animal that becomes aggressive when they're hungry. Careful! They have nearly same attack range the player has and has 3000 HP- 6 times more than a creeper in TFC! Stone axes needs about 30 hits to kill a bear. Bronze swords needs only 8-9 hits.\nIn this mod pack, we're proud to introduce the RPG mod which has been customized a lot and translated into Chinese. It gives you ability to gain skills using XP. It gives you things similar as enchantments that you can't get in TFC: Mining speed, Attack Damage, Defense of fire and explosion, movement speed(A bit not sure if it works) and a chance to drop extra blocks.\nDownload Address:\n现在上传不了图片？那么等会再看看，或者上到其他论坛什么的..\nhttp://pan.baidu.com/s/1nhtVK\n看起来这个版不让用ADFLY？那么直接贴上\n\n",
