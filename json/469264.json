    "txt_content": "先上说明书\nThank you for Downloading CustomMobs!\n\n################################################################################################\n### If you're using a spigot server, you don't have to patch. Just have fun using the Plugin ###\n################################################################################################\n\nUsing patchfiles on non-supported servers is at your own risk.\n\nAlways prepare backups in case a patch doesn't work as planned.\nPatches are only for the same server-versions as the folder they are in.\n(Example: If you have craftbukkit v1_8_R1 then you'll need the patchfile in the folder v1_8_R1)\n\nHOW TO PATCH:\n\n1. Your server needs to be stopped and you have to have access to the server.jar\n2. Open your server.jar with WinRAR, WinZip or anything that can open archives.\n3. Open the directories: net -> minecraft -> server\n4. The folder you are in now contains a folder that's named like a version number. Remember that version.\n5. Open the \"Patchfiles\" directory in the CustomMobs Archive and open the folder that has the same version as your server.\n6. In the folder you'll find one (or probably more) files. This/These are the Patchfile/s you need.\n7. Open the version-folder in your server jar (net -> minecraft -> server -> <version>)\n8. Copy all your patchfiles into there and replace if needed. Done.\n\nFAQ:\n\nQ: There are no patchfiles for the server version i'm using (example: v1_6_3). Can i even use your plugin somehow?\nA: No you can't. CustomMobs (v3.0) does only support 1.7 and 1.8 minecraft servers.\n\nQ: I use MCPC/Forge/... (or whatever other server version than CB or spigot). How to make your plugin work with it?\nA: I don't support MCPC/Forge/whatever. Only craftbukkit and spigot builds are supported.\n\nQ: My server doesn't have a directory named net, net/minecraft, net/minecraft/server, ... What to do now?\nA: Then you don't use a craftbukkit or spigot server - only craftbukkit and spigot servers are supported.\n\n~HellFirePvP\n\n\n我是Spigot的，所以说明书看到前几句就直接把插件丢进去了\n然后就发现了这个\n\n\n\n\nQQ图片20150715160117.png (19.25 KB, 下载次数: 0)\n\n下载附件\n\n2015-7-15 16:02 上传\n\n\n\n\n\n\n于是就决定打补丁\n\n\n\n\nQQ截图20150715160250.png (33.01 KB, 下载次数: 0)\n\n下载附件\n\n2015-7-15 16:02 上传\n\n\n\n\n\n\n然而...我完全没搞懂这补丁应该打哪\n所以来求助了，奉上我仅剩的62颗金粒(税收后60)以表诚意\n",
