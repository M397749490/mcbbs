Beneath them, lining the roads, are multi-storey farms, producing fruit and vegetables for the local populace. There are strange sail-shaped constructions that suck carbon dioxide out of the air, and along the canals, hydrogen powered boats glide silently through crystal clear waters. This is Climate Hope City – and for now, it exists only in Minecraft.\n\nWhen the Guardian launched its Keep it in the Ground campaign in March, editor-in-chief Alan Rusbridger, and other senior staff, spoke about the challenge of finding new ways to discuss and report on climate change – to break out of traditional journalism and explore fresh ideas.\n\n“We carry on flogging a load of dead horses, in exactly the same way, with exactly the same whip,” wrote columnist and environmentalist George Monbiot. “We have to constantly be reinventing our storytelling capacity.”\n\nOne answer to that challenge is to envisage a future zero carbon city in Minecraft. The hugely successful block-building game allows players to construct complex and fascinating models of everything from medieval castles to giant space cruisers. Climate Hope City is not a fantasy world but a vision of a green urban environment which uses technologies that either already exist around the world or are at the prototype stage.\n\nThe project was overseen by expert Minecraft modeller Adam Clarke, who makes his own YouTube videos about the game, as Wizard Keen. Clarke recently worked with the Tate Modern gallery to produce the Tate Worlds project, a series of Minecraft maps based around art works such as André Derain’s The Pool of London. Recently, he has started Wonder Quest, a new educational series of YouTube videos co-written with Minecraft superstar Stampy Cat.\n\nTogether with James Delaney and his BlockworksMC team of builders, as well as experienced map maker and designer Dragnoz, Clarke took various real-life urban climate technologies and spent a week constructing them into a Minecraft environment. Features include vertical farms, kinetic pavements that convert footsteps into electricity, driverless cars and green roofs.\n\n“James and his team had recently built a Minecraft map called Tomorrowland,” says Clarke. “We wanted Climate Hope City to feel positive and futuristic yet at the same time rooted in what is going on in architecture and climate change science today. Our research led us to the very latest in building design, featuring radical shapes and forms.”\n\n“We also wanted to see some older buildings so that the city felt realistic and built upon. We added the spiral walkway to help players explore the various features as quickly as possible, but its also became a very beautiful design motif too.”\n\nDelaney and his team of five builders, started out by sketching a rough layout, based on emerging technologies and architectural models, before spending over 100 hours building the model itself. “We needed to use existing green technologies and prototypes to create a positive image for sustainable living, which also seemed achievable and not too far off reality,” says Delaney.\n\n“We decided to form the city around natural looking curves and spirals rather than the grid layout of many of the world’s modern cities: Zaha Hadid’s architecture was one inspiration, the new biodome concept for Amazon’s new Seattle headquarters was another. We then proceeded to lay it out in Minecraft and slowly build upwards, adapting and accommodating that plan to the city as it developed.”\n\nThe result is a rather beautiful and elegant Minecraft city, filled with intriguing buildings, and criss-crossed with canals and kinetic walkways. Guardian readers will also be able to spot the newspaper’s own office.\n\nThe map is now ready to download and is available for free to anyone who has the PC, Linux or Mac version of Minecraft installed on their computer. It can be found at the Climate Hope City Planet Minecraft page. You can freely explore the city, read signposts and listen to audio recordings that tell you more about what each building and feature represents.\n\n“Despite climate change being the biggest story of our age, journalism has largely failed to get to grips with it,” says the Guardian’s assistant national news editor, James Randerson. “In our mission to tell this story differently and reach new audiences, we have enlisted the help of artists, poets, comedians and composers to name a few. Now we’re harnessing the creativity of some talented Minecraft designers to imagine a future low carbon city – and crucially one that is not far out of reach.”\n\nThe Guardian’s Keep it in the Ground campaign is highlighting the global fossil fuel divestment movement. In particular it is calling on the world’s two largest health charities – the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and the Wellcome Trust – to move their endowments out of those firms.\n\n\n篠君的譯文：\n氣候希望之都：如何用Minecraft訴說氣候變化的故事\n作為“Keep it in the Ground”活動的一部分，衛報委託建造一個Minecraft地圖來呈現真實世界中正為氣候變化而行動的城市。\n\n屋頂上，有無盡的芬芳花園，使城市的天際線看起來就像那廣闊熱帶雨林的簇擁著的樹梢。在它們之下，道路兩旁，是多層農場，為當地住民生產並提供蔬菜和水果。看，那奇怪的帆形建築正從空氣中吸走二氧化碳呢！沿著運河，氫動力運輸船靜靜地在如水晶般清澈的海水中行駛。這就是氣候希望之都——從現在來看，它僅僅只存在於Minecraft這款遊戲之中。\n\n衛報在三月份舉辦了“Keep it in the Ground”活動，總編輯Alan Rusbridge和其他高級工作人員，在談到如何尋找討論和報導氣候變化的新方式時——打破了傳統的新聞觀念並探索出了新的想法。\n\n“我們仍在鞭打著一群死馬，以同樣的方式，用同樣的鞭子，”專欄作家、環保人士George Monbiot說道。“我們必須不停地提高講故事的能力。”\n\n這個挑戰的回答是在Minecraft中設想並建造一個零碳排放的未來城市。獲得巨大成功的方塊構建遊戲允許玩家建造複雜而引人入勝的模型，從中世紀城堡到巨型太空巡洋艦。氣候希望之都不是一個充滿幻想的世界，這個綠色城市技術在世界各地都已經大部分實現或還在試驗階段。\n\n這個地圖的概念是出自著名的Minecraft建築師Adam Clarke，他經常用自己的YouTube視頻介紹遊戲。Clarke最近與泰特現代美術館合作，製作有關泰特世界的項目——以藝術作品為基礎的一系列Minecraft地圖，如安德烈德蘭的“The Pool of London”。最近，他開始與Minecraft巨星Stampy Cat一起製作“Wonder Quest”，一個新的教育系列YouTube視頻。\n\n再加上James Delaney和他的BlockWorks建築團隊，以及經驗豐富的地圖製作者和設計師Dragnoz，Clarke採用各種現實生活中的城市環境優化技術，花了整整一個星期時間建造出這個Minecraft環境作品。其特點包括垂直農場，把人的腳步轉換成電能的動力路面，無人駕駛汽車和屋頂綠化工程。\n\n“James和他的團隊最近建造了一個Minecraft地圖，名為‘明日世界’”，Clarke說。“我們期待氣候希望之都能給人積極和前瞻的感受，告訴人們今天建築界和氣象學界正在發生的事情。另外，我們還查找了最新的具有激進形狀和風格的建築設計。\n\n“我們也希望看到一些舊建築，使城市感覺更加真實。我們添加了螺旋走道，幫助玩家更快捷、更方便地探索城市的各種功能，它也與城市融為一體，成為其中一個非常漂亮的設計主題了。“\n\nDelaney和他的建築團隊，在花費超過100小時建造此地圖前，繪製了一些粗略的佈局，探索了一些新興技術和建築模型。“我們需要利用現有的綠色技術和原型創造可持續發展的生活方式和真實的積極形象，這似乎是可實現的，並不遙遠。”Delaney說。\n\n“我們決定把城市周圍做成自然的曲線和螺旋線，而不是世界上許多現代化城市的網格佈局：Zaha Hadid建築的靈感，亞馬遜的新總部西雅圖的新自然生態博物館的概念。我們接著在Minecraft中奠基，慢慢向上建造，調整和適應城市發展的計劃。“\n\n它的結果終於出來了，是一個相當美麗典雅的Minecraft城市，充滿了迷人的建築，縱橫交錯的運河和動力人行道。細心的衛報讀者也能夠發現報社的辦公室。\n\n該地圖現在已經提供免費下載給任何擁有PC，Linux或Mac版本的Minecraft用戶。你可以在 Planet Minecraft的氣候希望之都頁面找到鏈接。你可以自由遊覽城市，讀路標，聽錄音，讓它們告訴你各種建築的功能。\n\n“儘管氣候變化是這個時代的大新聞，但人們在很大程度上沒有去正視它，”衛報助理兼國家新聞編輯，James Randerson說道。“我們的宗旨是不斷地講述這個故事，在藝術家、詩人、演員和作曲家的幫助下讓民眾更多地了解它。現在，我們與一些有才華的設計師合作，在Minecraft中建造想像的未來低碳城市——更為關鍵的是這‘遙而可及’。”\n\n衛報“Keep it in the Ground”活動是全球化石燃料的撤資運動。尤其是它呼籲了世界上兩個最大的健康慈善機構——比爾和梅琳達·蓋茨基金會、維康基金會——把它們的贈款撤出那些公司。",
