No but seriously, there was a big issue causing mobs to suffocate and fall through wooden floors that we really needed to fix. The full list of fixes are…\n\nFixed mobs glitching through wooden floorsFixed players glitching through BeaconsFixed Redstone Repeaters getting stuck in ‘on’ stateBats spawn less frequentlyA number of minor font fixesActivated the Wither paintingFixed wet wolves looking way too scaryTweaked naming costs in the AnvilTweaked enchantment points reward for smeltingFixed bug that allowed any item to be placed in the armor slotsFixed mob spawners spawning too quickly\n\nSince we do these pre-releases mainly to prepare modders and server admins (and not to find and fix bugs), we’ve decided to push the release of 1.4(.1) one day to Thursday, October 25. Again, since I know this is a lot of text to read:\n\nRelease date: Thursday October 25\nDownload the pre-release here:\n\n客户端下载: http://assets.minecraft.net/1_4_1/minecraft.jar\n服务端下载: http://assets.minecraft.net/1_4_1/minecraft_server.jar (or EXE)\n// The Minecraft Team",
