Saved structures can then be pasted back into the world可以让作者复制和保存一部分区块，然后粘贴到不同的地方To get a Structure Block, you must use the ‘/give’ command使用/give命令获得When a structure is being loaded in, it can also be mirrored or rotated可以将其保存的东西镜像翻转或者旋转Structure Void blocks can be placed in an area to not copy air into the target area结构空位方块在选定区域放置时不会再复制空气了See How to Play in the game for more details and tips!请在游戏中阅读更多详细信息！\n\nFor Map Makers and Add-On Creators:给地图和附加包制作者：Updated templates for 1.13.0 with new resources, behaviors, documentation, and example packs can be downloaded from aka.ms/MinecraftAddons升级模板文件至1.13.0版本，内含新的材质，行为包和文档，请至aka.ms/MinecraftAddons下载\n\nNew Data-Driven Objects for Add-Ons新的数据驱动对象和Add-Ons\nBrewing stand potion recipes are now data-driven酿造台的药水配方现在属于数据驱动Arrow shake animation (MCPE-40744)箭头射中后的摇摆动画现在属于数据驱动Item breaking particles破坏物品产生的例子现在属于数据驱动Data-driven environment damage for entities实体产生的环境破坏现在属于数据驱动Added 'push' component that determines whether an entity can be pushed加入“push”组件以确定实体是否被推动Added 'persistent' component that determines whether an entity should be persistent in the game world加入“persistent”组件以确定实体是否应该保持持久Turtle Lightning interactions are now data-driven海龟被雷劈的交互事件现在属于数据驱动Pufferfish puffed states are now data-driven河豚膨胀的状态现在属于数据驱动Guardian/Elder Guardian animation and rendering对于守卫者/远古守卫者数据驱动的动画和渲染\nFixed unparented geometry on pre-1.8 guardians修复了1.8之前守卫者形状非父级的问题Elder Guardian spike animation远古守卫者攻击动画现在属于数据驱动\nFishing hook将钓鱼鱼钩动画转换为数据驱动Horse models and animations马的模型/动画现在属于数据驱动Snow Golem trail behavior雪傀儡移动并产雪的行为现在属于数据驱动Dragon Breath particles龙息粒子现在属于数据驱动Sparkler particles (Education)烟花粒子现在属于数据驱动（教育版）Balloons (Education)气球摆动动画现在属于数据驱动（教育版）\n\nScript Engine脚本引擎\nActor Definition Events can now be triggered from scripts脚本现在可以触发并参与已被定义的事件Scripting logs can now be opened and viewed while the game is running在游玩的时候可以打开并查看脚本日志Added new scripting Actor tags添加新的角色标签Added 'container' scripting component for blocks为方块添加“container”脚本组件Added 'projectile_hit' scripting event新增“projectile_hit”脚本事件Added 'entity_hurt' scripting event新增“entity_hurt”脚本事件Added 'entity_sneak' scripting event新增“entity_sneak”脚本事件Added 'entity_attack' scripting event新增“entity_attack”脚本事件Added 'block_exploded' scripting event新增“block_exploded'”脚本事件\nAdded new feature rules data that implements existing biome decoration through JSON加入新的数据规则特性，可以通过JSON实现现对于生物群落的装饰\nFinal infrastructure changes required to support fully data-driven features.

We recommend that any new packs or world templates that you create use format version of 2 from now on. With this new format, there are a few additional changes to be aware of, detailed below自1.13开始，我们修改了包的实现形式并将版本格式修改为“2”。自现在开始，我们推荐所有创建包或世界模板的版本格式为“2”。同时有一些小细节是需要注意的，请见下文。\n\n\n\n\nAll Pack Types所有包的格式\nThe 'name' field in the header is now required for all pieces of content所有内容的开头都应该有名字注明范围。\n\n\nWorld Templates世界模板\nThe 'lock_template_options' field is now required. This Boolean field determines whether the world options for your template should be locked to default values when a player creates a world from the template. They can still choose to unlock and modify the options, but will be warned that doing so could affect gameplay“lock_template_options”字段现在是必需的。这个布尔值注明了当玩家使用模板创建世界时，世界选项是否锁定为默认值。但玩家仍然可以选择解锁和修改设置，同时也会弹出警告注明会影响游戏玩法。The 'base_game_version' field is required (see below for more info)“base_game_version”字段现在是必需的（参见下方）The 'min_engine_version' field should no longer be used as it isn't parsed on world templates and produces a warning on import最好不使用“min_engine_version”字段，因为它不会生效，并且在导入时还会发出警告。\n\n\n\nResource and Behavior Packs材质和行为包\nThe 'min_engine_version' field is now required. This affects how the game interprets some of the assets loaded from Resource and Behavior Packs. We recommend using the latest available version of the game for this field (e.g. '[1, 13, 0]') to ensure your pack works correctly“min_engine_version”字段现在是必需的。这会告诉游戏应该加载材质包或行为包中的哪些资源。为了确保包能正常工作，我们推荐将此字段设置成最新的游戏版本（比如[1, 13, 0]）。\n\n\n\nBase Game Version Field基本游戏版本字段\nFor this field, we recommend using the value \"*\". This will ensure that anyone using your content in their Minecraft worlds will always get the latest base game (Vanilla) content when an update is available.针对这个字段，我们推荐使用“*”这个值。这会确保在更新可用的时候，人人将你的内容用在他们的Minecraft世界中时，都可取得最新的原版游戏（vanilla）内容。In the case that your content relies on specific base game behavior, you can use this field to specify a base game version, starting with 1.13. If you choose to do this, you should omit the third octet; for example, if the version of the game you are targeting is '[1, 14, 2]', you would specify a version of '[1, 14, 0]'). If you specify a version this way, any worlds using your custom content will not get new base game content when it becomes available in future releases, which could help prevent unwanted changes to behavior in your content caused by updates to the base game. However, we still recommend using the \"*\" value to ensure players can continue to enjoy your content in their Minecraft worlds long-term while also receiving updates to the base game从1.13开始，如果你的内容需要特殊基本游戏行为的支持，你可以使用这个字段来确定基本游戏版本。如果你选择这样做，你应该忽略不使用第三个数字（第八位）; 举个例子，假如你要把你的游戏版本定为“[1, 14, 2]”，那你应该将版本定为“[1, 14, 0]”。倘若你采用此方式，那么，只要那个世界使用了你的自定义内容，将来游戏出新版本后世界都不会获取新版本的游戏内容，这可以避免因为升级游戏版本而带来的“行为被意外更改”事件的发生。然而，我们依然推荐使用“*”这个值来确保玩家可以获取基本游戏更新的同时，还可以继续在他们的Minecraft世界中畅玩你的内容。\n\nbug修复：\n修复了255个bug\n\n（点击可展开）\n\n\nFixes:Crashes\nFixed several crashes that could occur during gameplayFixed a crash that could occur while navigating menusFixed a crash that could occur when trying to create new world or when joining a multiplayer gameFixed a crash that could occur when a player left a multiplayer gameFixed a crash that could occur when signing into a Microsoft accountFixed a crash that could occur when switching profiles on Xbox OneFixed a crash that could occur when launching the game on Xbox OneFixed a crash that could occur when typing certain characters onto a signFixed a crash that could occur when exploring world templatesFixed a crash that could occur when choosing certain skinsFixed a crash that could occur when breaking a block underneath a Detector RailFixed a crash that could occur when creating a new world using some Marketplace packsFixed a crash that could occur when exiting the game on Windows 10Fixed a crash that could sometimes occur when approaching world spawn (MCPE-46686)Fixed a crashing issue on iOS when relaunching the game with a global resource pack appliedFixed a crash that occurred when accepting the storage permission on AndroidFixed a crash that could occur when resuming the game on Oculus RiftFixed a crash that could occur when launching the game on Oculus RiftFixed a crash that occurred when typing certain characters into chat (MCPE-44419)Fixed a crash that could occur if a split-screen player left the game while an execute command targeted them in a functionFixed a crash that could occur after a player left the game on 3 or 4 player split-screen on the \"Wildlife: Jungle\" mapFixed a crash that could occur when leaving and rejoining a world whilst an adult panda is eating bambooFixed a freezing issue that could occur when resuming the game on Windows 10 MobileFixed a crashing issue that affected certain worlds when approaching spawn (MCPE-46686)Fixed a crash that could occur after changing the File Storage location on Android devicesFixed a crash that could occur on low and mid-end Android devicesFixed a crash that could occur when trying to double-tap on an item on the Beacon screenFixed a crash that could occur while downloading multiple Marketplace items at the same time on some iOS devicesFixed a crash related to cached resources\n\nPerformance\nImproved world launch time by optimizing network and resource tasksImproved performance when opening the inventorySeveral performance improvements regarding block renderingFixed a drop in performance when flying with Elytra in The EndOptimized terrain light calculationOptimized grass growth block ticking\n\nGeneral\nThe \"We are being attacked!\" and \"I've got a bad feeling about this\" achievements can once again be unlocked (MCPE-45060)The \"Renewable Energy\" achievement is once again unlockable (MCPE-39661)The \"Where have you been?\" achievement now unlocks correctly on AndroidMaps are now drawn more quickly when exploring, meaning the \"Map Room\" achievement now unlocks more consistently (MCPE-27720)Fixed some instances of skin selections not saving and reverting to Alex or Steve (MCPE-32089)Fixed the \"Multiplayer Restricted Skin!\" error message that would pop up when trying to join a world before the skin had loaded in (MCPE-48494)The world loading screen now closes once an acceptable amount of chunks have loaded (MCPE-44815)Fixed issues related to unloaded chunks that could appear in Realms and local worlds (REALMS-1553)Partially fixed an issue that caused global resources not to be applied after relaunching the gameMinecraft on iOS will no longer show the \"Do you want to Close Minecraft\" pop-up since iOS doesn't support that app behaviorAdded a new option in Accessibility settings that to auto-enable Text to Speech when the platform has it enabled.
