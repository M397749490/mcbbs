            "txt_content": "Emeralds like jade and all gems and semi precious stones are minerals. \n\nEmeralds is considered green beryl and belongs to the beryl family of minerals along with aquamarine, heliodor, morganite, goshenite, red emerald, and golden beryl. They all share the same chemical composition and have many of the same physical characteristics such as hardness and crystal structure, but are formed and given color by the influence of other trace elements present during their formation. Only green beryl that is gem-like in quality is considered an emerald.\n\nJade is a term that actually is used for two different types of stone: Jadeite and Nephrite, both are green and both are minerals made up of different types of silicates, but they are not the same. Both types have close to the same hardness as quartz which rates at 6.5 - 7.0 on the Moh's Scale (Beryls are harder at 7.5 - 8.0).\n\nIf you place a piece of jade next to an emerald the difference will be very clear. Jade is opaque and emerald is mostly translucent or transparent. Both can be carved, though jade is much softer. Only low quality emerald specimens are likely to be carved as the value of top quality emeralds can reach well over $10,000 per carat (1/5 of a gram).\n\n\n\n\n\n啊啊啊啊我不知道了，我对玉石的特征了解不多。。。"
