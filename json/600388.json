Therefore the Minecraft community is also a great help resource, especially when it comes to dealing with more technical issues.\n\nMinecraft Forum - Talk with other Minecraft enthusiasts about almost anything\nMinecraft Wiki - Most likely the biggest Minecraft knowledge base around\n#MineCraftHelp on irc.esper.net - If you're into IRC, this channel is where you can get help from other Minecrafters (PC/Mac help only)\n\n",
