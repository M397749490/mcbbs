In the future, it will get a complete redesign which will hopefully differentiate it from other work stations.\n\n- Flying Pigs now only drop Raw Pork, and no longer drop Feathers.\n\n- New Blue Berry bushes have been added to the mod. They will commonly generate around the Aether, and when destroyed will reward you with a random amount of Blue Berries. Blue Berries heal half a heart. In the Bush's place, a Bush Stem will stand there and over time grow back into another Blue Berry Bush. This means that you could, if desired, make a farm of Blue Berry bushes!\n\n- New Festive Tree! These trees can sometimes be seen in the masses, but other times very rarely. They emit snow particles around them, freezing over entire lands!\n\n- Present Block added! These Presents can be found underneath and around Festive Trees. Don't be fooled though: these presents may seem friendly but they (upon random chance) can either turn out bad or turn out very good for the receiver. Be careful but don't be hesitant! \n\n- Added 3 new secret items!\n\n- Added 1 new music piece to the Aether soundtrack, composed by the talented Emile! Listen to it here.\n\n- Invisibility Capes improved significantly. While worn, mobs can no longer see you unless you swing your fist/sword, making it a very useful tool indeed!\n\n- Temporarily removed main menu music and the quick load feature. Sorry guys! They will be back very soon \n"
