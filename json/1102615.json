Learning second language in school can help students to communicate when they go to another country. If they learn second language at school, they don’t need to work hard to learn second language when they don’t have good memory. Some people may say that learning second language at school will make students feel very tired, but doing this reduce the time students need to consume when they grow up. So students should be required to learn a second language in school.Learning second language is a necessary progress that the students need to finish if they went to another country to learn knowledge. When they go to another country to learn, we need to buy food, study and meet people. There are a lot of students so your teacher would teach in your language because of you.These things all need other language to finish. So that learning another language is a irreplaceable process.If student don’t learn second language in school, student need to work hard to learn second language when they grow up. The investigation of a college shows that before 13, people can remember things in the clearest way. It shows that we should try to remember more things when we are young. If the family speak more than 1 language, the kids have better ability to understand language.Some people may say that learning second language at school will make students feel unhappy, but doing this reduce the time they need to use when they grow up. One study of a college shows that studying English can make kids have better ability to understand language.Learning second language in school can help students to communicate. If student don’t learn second language in school, student need to work hard to learn second language when they grow up. Some people may say that learning second language at school will make students feel unhappy, but doing this reduce the time they need to use when they grow up. So students should learn a second language in school.\n@Ponyville @奇怪的帽子 @燃雪听风 @迷离fyx @新人x号 @晴曦之雨 @AzZ丶许愿 @PercyDan @Stray79 @小猫不喝水 @专刀你 @无谓z @西灬瓜 @Mr.时间之瓶 @曦灬月 @800805 @伟大的小安 @用户NJW \n",
