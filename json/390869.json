    "txt_content": " 本帖最后由 Yihc 于 2015-1-26 19:28 编辑 \n\n大家好，好久不见，无聊中找了点文章翻译，有错的地方希望见谅。\n\n\n\n                    ：字体颜色为黑为原文部分\n                    ：字体颜色为蓝为吐槽/本人部分\n                    ：字体颜色为灰为翻译部分 \n\n\n\n\n\n原文：\n\n\nSo, in 1.6 (I think x3) minecraft was introduced to HORSES! <3 \n\nPlease continue reading if you want to know more about horses and how to find the perfect one for you! \n\nSo, horses come in these colours:  \nThere are 35 different horses to pick from! Pick your favourite and let's move on! \n\nNext comes speed. Horses can be as slow as 0.1125 and as fast as 0.3375. (Player walk = 0.1000). The average horse's speed is 0.225. You can also give your horse treats to increase the speed =  \nIf you have a laggy computer, the slower ones will be easier to control. The faster ones tend to be harder to control so they will work better with a better computer. Pick your speed and lets keep going! \n\nJump height is also very important. A horse's jump can range from 1.5 blocks to 5.5 blocks (You can get higher jumping horses using plugins). When a horse jumps it rears into the air: \nAlthough it is unrealistic, the rearing effect causes the horse to lift a few blocks into the air and move forward slightly. Even if you have a laggy computer, the jump height is not that hard to control. Pick a jump height and let's keep going! \n\nNaming your horse is also very important. I don't know why... but it is to me xD Naming it Grumm or Dinnerbone will cause the horse to flip upsidedown: \n\nFinally, health! A horse's health can range from 15 health (7.5 hearts) to 30 health (15 hearts). However, using plugins, command blocks or glitches can cause a horse to have more hearts than it is expected to have:\nPick your horse's health and let's finish! \n\n\nNow put them all together and you have your perfect horse! \n\n\n\n\n翻译：\n\n\n\n在1.6的版本中新添加了一种生物“马”\nSo, in 1.6 (I think x3) minecraft was introduced to HORSES! <3\n\n\n如果你想知道更多关于马的信息~以及如何在漫漫马海中找到那个最好的它，那么请继续看下去！\nPlease continue reading if you want to know more about horses and how to find the perfect one for you!\n\n\n马总共有以下几种颜色:\nSo, horses come in these colours:  \n\n\n\n\n有35种不同型号可供挑选！选择你的最爱~（（#-_-)┯━┯型号是什么东西）\nThere are 35 different horses to pick from! Pick your favourite and let's move on! \n\n\n下面讲速度，马最慢可达到0.1125km/h,最快可达到0.3375km/h，（玩家走路速度0.1000km/h）一般的马最高时速0.225km/h，但是你也可以给你的马添加最高时速，俗称换马达（(-_-#)好好给我翻译）\nNext comes speed. Horses can be as slow as 0.1125 and as fast as 0.3375. (Player walk = 0.1000). The average horse's speed is 0.225. You can also give your horse treats to increase the speed =  \n\n\n\n\n对于那些快马他们往往很难控制，但是如果你的电脑是中下水准，相对来说还是比较容易控制的，因为帧数会下降，所以要骑快马你得有部中上级别的电脑(土豪金)，那么挑选你心仪的对象吧速度吧\nIf you have a laggy computer, the slower ones will be easier to control. The faster ones tend to be harder to control so they will work better with a better computer. Pick your speed and lets keep going! \n\n\n对于跳跃高度来说也是很重要的，你以为马不用找个一米七的？马的跳跃高度范围为：1.5至5.5格高的方块高度（你可以使用插件来跳的更高），当马在天空翱翔时：\nJump height is also very important. A horse's jump can range from 1.5 blocks to 5.5 blocks (You can get higher jumping horses using plugins). When a horse jumps it rears into the air: \n\n\n\n\n如果你在Minecraft里找科学。。  用饲养来让马达到跳跃高度~还是那句话如果你电脑是中下，当马跳的很高在空中翱翔的时候还不难控制~所以选择你想要跳的高度~Although it is unrealistic, the rearing effect causes the horse to lift a few blocks into the air and move forward slightly. Even if you have a laggy computer, the jump height is not that hard to control. Pick a jump height and let's keep going! \n\n\n当然你也得给你的马去个响当当的名字，我也不知道为啥子，反正我就喜欢，你不爽来打我啊（误） 如果你把马命名为Grumm或者Dinnerbone，那么你得准备脉动了，他们会颠倒。（ヽ(`Д?)? (￣ε(#￣) Σ）\nNaming your horse is also very important. I don't know why... but it is to me xD Naming it Grumm or Dinnerbone will cause the horse to flip upsidedown: \n\n\n\n\n最后，关于马的生命值，马的生命值范围是在15健康(7.5心)至30健康(15心)，但是，如果使用插件，命令方块，或者BUG，可以让你的马获得更多的生命~\nFinally, health! A horse's health can range from 15 health (7.5 hearts) to 30 health (15 hearts). However, using plugins, command blocks or glitches can cause a horse to have more hearts than it is expected to have:  \n\n\n选择你想要的生命值~\nPick your horse's health and let's finish! \n\n\n然后综合以上，把所有你心仪的属性集合起来，马就会进化啦！你就会得到一匹完美的马了。\nNow put them all together and you have your perfect horse! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(??_?`)翻译完毕了，感谢各位收看，有翻译错误的地方请务必指正。\n\n\n(╯°口°)╯(┴—┴等翻译完这篇文章我才知道，这只是培养调教人马PLAY\n\n金币呢？人气呢？\n\n\n",
