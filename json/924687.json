His first album, Little, was released in 1990,[5] but his breakthrough to commercial success didn't come until 1996 with the release of Sweet Relief II: Gravity of the Situation, a charity record of alternative artists covering his songs.[6]\nJames Victor Chesnutt (1964.11.12-2009.12.25) 是一位美国唱作歌手，来自乔治亚州雅典市。他在1990年发表了他的第一张专辑《Little》，但是直到1996年发行了《Sweet Relief II: Gravity of the Situation》后才终于取得商业上的成功，这是一张慈善专辑，囊括了包含他在内的多位艺术家的歌曲。\n\nChesnutt released 17 albums during his career, including two produced by Michael Stipe, and a 1996 release on Capitol Records, About to Choke. His musical style has been described by Bryan Carroll of allmusic.com as a \"skewed, refracted version of Americana that is haunting, funny, poignant, and occasionally mystical, usually all at once\".[7]\nChesnutt的生涯中一共发行了17张专辑，其中两张的制作人是 Michael Stipe，以及一张由Capitol Records厂牌发行的专辑《About to Choke》。来自allmusic.com的Bryan Carroll将他的音乐风格描述为“扭曲、偏折的美式乡村风格，令人感觉挥之不去，搞怪逗趣，尖锐沉痛，偶尔又神秘莫测，这些感受通常会一齐呈现。”\n\nInjuries from a 1983 car accident left him partially paralyzed; he used a wheelchair and had limited use of his hands.\n一场发生于1983年的车祸造成的伤使得他的身体部分瘫痪；他需要坐轮椅，手部活动也有限。\n\n\nThe 2005 album Ghetto Bells featured famed guitarist Bill Frisell, whom Chesnutt met in 2004 at the Century of Song concert series at the German festival Ruhrtriennale. Ghetto Bells also featured lyricist and composer Van Dyke Parks on accordion and keyboards. Chesnutt's wife, Tina, would frequently play bass on his albums, including Ghetto Bells. His niece, and fellow songwriter, Liz Durrett also appeared on the album.\n在发行于2005年的专辑《Ghetto Bells》中，知名吉他手Bill Frisell提供了演奏，Chesnutt与他相识于2004年德国鲁尔艺术节的《Century of Song》系列音乐会。《Ghetto Bells》同时也有作词、作曲家Van Dyke Parks的参与，他在其中演奏了手风琴和键盘。Chesnutt的妻子Tina经常在他的专辑中演奏贝斯，在《Ghetto Bells》中也是如此。Liz Durrett，他的侄女、作曲家同好，也参与到了专辑中。\n\n\nOn Christmas Day, December 25, 2009, Chesnutt died from an overdose of muscle relaxants that had left him in a coma in an Athens hospital. He was 45 years of age.[6] In his final interview, which aired on National Public Radio 24 days before his death, Chesnutt said that he had \"attempted suicide three or four times [before]. It didn't take.\"[8]\n在圣诞节当天，即2009年12月25日，Chesnutt因服用过量的肌肉松弛剂而陷入昏迷，在一家雅典市的医院逝世，享年45岁。24天前，在美国国家公共广播电台的节目中，Chesnutt在自己最后的一次采访中提到，他（之前）已经“尝试自杀有三到四次了。不过没有成功。”\n\nAccording to him in the same interview, being \"uninsurable\" due to his quadriplegia, he was $50,000 in debt for his medical bills, and had been putting off a surgery for a year (\"And, I mean, I could die only because I cannot afford to go in there again. I don't want to die, especially just because of I don't have enough money to go in the hospital.\").[8]\n在同一场采访中，他表示自己由于四肢瘫痪而“无法上保险”，因此还欠着五万美元的药费，并且把手术推迟了一年。（“而且，如果我死了，只可能是因为负担不起再进一次医院了。我不想死，特别是得因为不够钱去医院而死。”）\n翻译自Wikipedia。",
