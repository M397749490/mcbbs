You can toggle each icon on and off to focus on only what you are looking for.\n\n\n&#8226;        You can add players as an Ally or an Enemy, and they will show up on your radar as either green or red respectively.\n\n\n&#8226;        As you type a player's name to add as an Ally or Enemy, names that match what you are typing based on the players currently in the game will appear to make player entry faster.\n\n\n&#8226;        You can toggle on and off Auto Rotation and Player Names.\n\n\n&#8226;        The settings for the radar as well as the Ally/Enemy lists are saved in your Minecraft directory at: .minecraft\\mods\\RadarBro\\\nFuture/Possible Features:\n\n-Ability to zoom in and out of radar\n-Customizable settings for size, colors, etc.\n-Height filter - show only entities above or below what you set\n-Notifications - for ally/enemy entering view or nearby creepers\n\n* If you have any other suggestions, please tell me.\n\n\nScreenshots:\n\n\nSpoiler:   \n\n\n\nPosted Image\n\nPosted Image\n\nPosted Image\n\nPosted Image\n\n\n\nVideos:\n\n(thanks to AntVenom)\n\n\n\n(thanks to ChimneySwift11)\n\n\n\n(thanks to GameChap)\n\n\n\n\nOther Videos:\n\n\nSpoiler:   \nhangelog (v1.9.9.9.9.9)\n\n- Added Horse to radar\n- Keybind button won't show in the Controls Menu anymore if the radar is disabled\n\n(Version 2.0 will feature a totally revamped system, including new features such as size customization, more waypoint functionality, and much more.)\n\n\nPast Changelog:\n\n\nSpoiler:   \n\n\nRadarBro is dependent on ModLoader.
