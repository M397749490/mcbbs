Conveniently enough, it’s our Block of the Week: Diorite!\n在Minecraft中哪一个方块遍布整个主世界，看起来有点像圆石，又有点像石英，而听起来则像是你在劈砍入侵你房子的僵尸时发出的叫喊？没错，这就是我们本周的方块：闪长岩！\nThe last member of a rocky trinity that also includes granite and andesite, diorite generates naturally in large seams anywhere that you’d normally find stone. You’ll regularly see it exposed to the surface, particularly in hilly or mountainous areas. Or you can craft it by combining cobblestone with nether quartz.\n这是由花岗岩、安山岩、闪长岩所组成的岩石三人组的最后一名成员，它自然的生成于任何你能够正常发现石头的地方。你会经常看到它暴露在地表，特别是在丘陵和山地。当然你也可以通过圆石和下界石英合成得到闪长岩。\nDiorite doesn’t have a whole lot of uses in Minecraft, except for decoration. There’s a nice polished variant which makes beautiful flooring, that you’ll get by putting four blocks of the raw stuff in a 2x2 crafting grid. You can also use it to make andesite and granite, and in Bedrock edition it can be used in place of stone to make slabs and redstone comparators.\n除了装饰，闪长岩在Minecraft并没有完整广泛的用途。但它有着一个漂亮的磨制类型用于制作地板，而制作它则需要你将四块原料放于2x2的合成网格中。你也可以用此种方法制作磨制花岗岩和安山岩，而在基岩版中他能替代石头被用于制作半砖和红石比较器。\nAs a building material, diorite is pretty great. It has the same blast resistance as stone, so Creepers and your sneaky multiplayer pals won’t do much damage to anything you construct out of it. Plus, it’s arguably the white-coloured material that’s easiest to get large quantities of, so if you want white as a colour in your next build then it’s a great option to look at.\n作为建筑材料，闪长岩是十分好用的。它有着和石头一样的抗爆性，所以苦力怕和熊孩子不会对你的建筑造成较大的破坏。另外，它可以说是最容易大量得到的白色材料，所以如果你想将白色作为你下一次建筑的主色调，这绝对是一个不错的选择。\nAs we discussed in the andesite block of the week, real-world diorite and andesite are kinda like rock brothers. They both form when magma cools down - but diorite is made when that happens inside the earth, while andesite is created when it flows out into the open air as lava.正如我们在本周方块：安山岩中所讨论的那样，闪长岩和安山岩在现实世界真的有点像摇滚兄弟，它们都是岩浆冷却时形成的-但闪长岩是在岩浆冷却于地球内部时形成，而安山岩则是以熔岩的形态流入露天后冷却形成的。\nDiorite’s speckles are made of crystals of different minerals, depending on the composition of the magma that it formed from. It’s found in volcanic areas, and in places where tectonic plates are shoved upwards by another plate passing underneath - like the Andes in South America.闪长岩的斑点是由不同矿物的晶体组成的，这取决于形成它的岩浆的组成。它一般被发现于火山地带，或是在一些像南美安第斯山脉的地方，一个板块被另一个从它下面穿过的板块向上猛然推起。\nDiorite is actually much rarer in the real world than it is in Minecraft. It’s also extremely hard, making it tough to carve - so it’s mostly used for decorative purposes. One famous diorite artifact is the Code of Hammurabi - a list of laws from ancient Babylon, inscribed on a two-meter tall chunk of diorite. The rock’s hardness means that the text is unusually well-preserved, and it’s one of the oldest fully-translated pieces of writing that we’ve found - dating back to about 1750 BC.其实闪长岩在现实中远比在Minecraft中罕见。它也十分的坚固，这使得它难以雕刻-因此它主要用于装饰。一个有名的闪长岩制品是汉谟拉比法典-一个古巴比伦法律的列表，它被刻在了一块两米高的大闪长岩上。岩石的坚硬意味着刻于其上的文本保存得十分完好，而这是我们已发现最古老的能够被完全翻译的著作之一-可以追溯到公元前1750年左右。\nSo next time you need something to write your server rules on, take a leaf out of Hammurabi’s book and consider a big pillar made of diorite. You never know, it might get dug up by future Minecraft archaeologists in the distant future, who’ll wonder why leaving a tree half-cut down was considered punishable by death.所以下次当你需要在一些东西上写下你的服务器规则时，请你以汉谟拉比法典为榜样，考虑一下由闪长岩所制作的大支柱。你永远也不会知道，它也许会被遥远未来的Minecraft考古学家所挖掘起来，而他们会想为什么只砍掉树的一半就会被判处死刑。\n\n\n原文链接：https://minecraft.net/zh-hans/article/block-week-diorite发布时间：2018年4月13日原文作者：Duncan Geere",
