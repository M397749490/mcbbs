You went downstairs but nobody was there. You went back upstairs thinking you might have heard things, but then you heard moving inside of your house. You went to go call the police but notice that the phone line was cut. You turned around and saw a man dressed in black. Then you got knocked out and woke up in a blue room and you were told you had tasks to complete.\n\n你坐在你的豪宅 Minecraft附近的一個村莊，當你聽說你的房子內移動。你去打電話報警，但發現，電話線被切斷。你轉身看見穿著黑色衣服的人。然後，你就擊倒了，醒來在藍色的房間，並告訴你，你必須要完成的任務。\n\n\n規則:1. 玩在和平2. Crafting是允許的，需要完成一些任務。3. 不破壞塊4. 沒有MODS.5. 沒有spawning item。6. 玩得開心!\n\n图片 :\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n资源:115网盘附件下载:MC Penguin.rar (633.18KB) \n\n",
