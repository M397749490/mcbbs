Words with bucket server family net does not work, I built many times, the upstairs very old, now under the latest version of I also will not make, hope you got to teach my forehead ~\nA good post, I help you in Translation(原帖：http://www.mcbbs.net/forum.php?mod=viewthread&tid=7245&extra=page%3D1%26filter%3Dtypeid%26typeid%3D133%26typeid%3D133\n\n翻译：\nFirst of all to download a http: / / wiki.bukkit.org / Main_Page (pull to the bottom has a L opening theme here is the file download download first ) and then I give you the attachment of the first I told you to download compressed don't unpack down anywhere anyway and then put it inside the attachment only one file extract and the compressed together and then double-click extracting files and it will automatically generate the map you see help or? Good but not close this window is this your server then you want to be in your server's folder location find sever properties use Notepad to open the inside online-mode = ture to online-mode = false. Then went to have a look at your home IP address into the multiplayer game input your IP you enter the game but this time someone or not online so you want to download a Hamachi installed after the click button create ( created when you create a direct point ) by the then it will automatically generate the IP address is in the button next to the usual format is 5.XX.XXX.XX anyway you remember the line ( back then. ) create a new network ID code a good after your ID and password to tell your friends that they add ( first get them to download Hamachi then point button to join an existing bukkit.rar ( 266 Bytes, download number: 127 )\nNetwork input your ID and password ) they will join your network and then allow them to open the game 5.XX.XXX.XX IP address and tell them to let them into the multiplayer and input the IP but you yourself into the game to the local connection IP not this then you can play together but must be the same version\n\n可能翻译有些坑爹，表示我是英语盲（百度翻译不解释）"
