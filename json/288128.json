Also removed all the molten metals in block form, was it really neccessary?Full Dropped BC Power Support, now you can only use RF to Power my machines, and turbines will only provide RFRemoved ConfigCopier/LegacyLoader > If upgrading from previous version, make sure to load Mariculture on 1.1.4 FIRSTOysters are more special ;)Scalable melting of damaged items.Air Pumps, are now 'tanks'. Instead of passing directly any gas they get to tanks, they now have an internal tank buffer of 8 buckets, which they will then attempt to transfer to the side.Right clicking an air pump with an item that rotates blocks such as a wrench will cause it to display, where you need air blocksAir Pumps now need larger areas in order to pump, however, Up to 6 Blocks in that area do not have to be air (So you can have ur engines on any side now)Air Pumps radius changed: Engine - 40 XZ, 50Y; Manual - 64 XZ: 64Y; Redstone - 25 XZ, 36YNo longer auto-outputting to any pipes, use itemductsAutofisher now uses more power to workTurbine Recipes changedTurbines (except manual) now need to be kept supplied with a Rotor, in order to operateSluice no longer has a gui, no longer needs wheels, can no longer take upgrades and no longer moves blocks(still picks up and places with tanks). They generate 10mB of Pressurised Water per Height every 10 seconds. They will only transfer their liquid automatically if they have a redstone signal.Pressure Vesels, can now store a LOT more per block, however they are much more expensive, but they can also be quite large sizes!Feeder Fish Tanks no longer need you to have a certain shape... You just need to have the correct amount of water blocks for the tank sizeJewelry no longer drops on death(configurable)Pressurised Water's range increased from 5 to 16Mariculture Enchants will now ONLY work on Jewelry (Removed Magic feather)Nerf to Never Hungry ;)Story Bookshelves now count as 5 Bookshelves for an Enchantment TableCan now right click on the sifter to throw bait in :) (as well as being able to throw it)Buffed Neon Lamp RecipeCan Repair Scuba Gear(Not Tank in an anvil) with Neoprene.Buffed Fish Oil DrinkingAir Compressor will now take RF directly, instead of needing to use batteriesDue to the new processing system for various things, the recipes for transparent plastic and hard plastic have been reduced to 30 buckets perAluminum and Titanium sheets, are no longer made in rolling machine or with flint and steel, but are now made in the blacksmith's anvil by crushing down their relevant blocksLeapfrog changed to an addition instead of a multiplierDifferent fuels, now have a tick time for how long they last in a smelter. Heating upgades no longer speed smelters up, but they will, help machines heat up faster, hyperkinetic upgrades are for speed, ethereal is no longer needed for certain biomes but instead it will make fuels, burn past using up their temperature per piece(but not generate heat, aka it will do what no redstone signal used to do).Smelters now will take either solid, or liquid, liquid fuel is pulled from tanks below themBottles now required Heat Resistant Glass(1000mB Quicklime, 16mB Molten Aluminum, 1 Glass Block in a VAT), And they now hold two ingots worth(for ingots)Limestone will now generate in any WATER tagged biome, so instead of just rivers, will now also generates in oceans. (But up to a max depth of 45Y)Changed Electricray Chance to 4%, and Dragonfish and Clownfish to 2%Buffed all Droplet ChancesBait, can now vary a lot more, with 'quality' ranging from 0-100% instead of the few tiers that there were beforeYou are now able to catch every single fish in the wild, however, all fish except for the starter fish will be forced dead!Raw Kelp is no longer edibleBe careful with Pressurised Water, as well as being fast, it will damage blocks that are stone hardness or lessThe chances with Fish Breeding are changed to make fish breeding easierTimelord now has a configurable percentage required, defaults to 5% of a serverSalinity is now split in to three types, Salt, Water and Magic. You convert to these different types by using Salinator, Purifier or Ethereal UpgradesWater Turbines now produce a base of 3 RF/T, but they can be upgraded to a max of 75RF/T with Hyperkinetic UpgradesGas Turbines now produce a base of 60 RF/T, but can be upgraded to a maximum of 300RF/TChanged FLUDD Recipe, now needs a Life CoreA lot of other stuff, too much to list!\nBugfixesFixed fishing rods using bait when pulling inFixed Speed Boat dropping twice when broken with a TiC pickFixed Incorrect Recipe for Titanium Pickaxe HeadOther ones i forget\nConfig ChangesAdded Retro-Generation OptionsRemoved Unused Block Ids for Molten Metals and Limestone StairsRennamed Autofisher Speed Entry (To force use of new SLOWER speed (since they now accept upgrades))Options to Disable the forcing of KelpForests/CoralReefs to only gen in those biomes with BOPLimestone chance mechanisms changed, instead of only ever having a possiblity to generate once per chunk, you now define how many times it will try to find a place it can generateRennamed bait.xml to sifter.xml (to force the changes, otherwise some of the existing items would have terrible values)Autodictionary config options to use whitelist instead of blacklist(blacklist is default)Water Ravines, Water Caves and Disabling mineshafts will no longer work if you have ATG InstalledSome more\n",
