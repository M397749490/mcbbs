            "txt_content": " 本帖最后由 cainiaowu 于 2012-4-19 21:48 编辑 \n\nSimcraft for minecraft a mod design with creativity in mind providing you with a complete new game dynamic and loads of extra building options. The mod is primarily based on HD textures lower resolutions however will be available, but to be able to fully appreciate this mod nothig lower than using the 64it texture pack and mod with the included 64Bit Textures is recommended.\n\nThe concept of SimCraft is to enhance your building and mining experience and to allow you to extend your game with endless possibilities. We have taken minecraft to a whole new level, the mod fully supports both SSP and SMP and the only dependencies at the moment is Modloader and Forge.\n\nWith SimCraft you will be able to build more types of buildings, mine more ores, have loads of decorations to add to your homes and this is only the beginning. The mod will always be well balanced, some features will be hard to craft or acquire while others will be a lot easier, but we try to keep a balance between content and usability of the item or block added, I have seen way too many mods out there that adds items and blocks with no use, bottom line is you can only have so many tools or weapons before it completely becomes senseless to even have more.\n\nWe have divided the mod up into Edition and will be launching one Edition at a time, the only reason for doing this is that there's so much content that we will be adding that you won't be able to play the mod for months to come, by dividing it into separate Editions, you can start to enjoy the mod and just add the next Edition to your game once it's release.\n\nThe First Edition will provide you with the following content\n\n- 16 New stone ores or stone variations.\n- 32 New ore types like Diamonds and Iron.\n- 12 New Fruit Trees each with it's won fruit that drops from leaves\n- 32 New Building Bricks ranging from stone bricks, bricks or floor bricks\n- 32 New Wooden Planks including 8 Wooden Floor Planks.\n- 16 New Windows to go with your new houses\n- 32 New Plants or Flowers all plant able in garden pots.\n- 16 New Garden Pots to plant your flowers in each with own theme.\n- 16 Coral Reefs spawning in the ocean, winch consists out of rocks and sea plants.\n- 32 Carpets to decorate your house with.\n- 10 Rooftops each with there own slopes and corners and own theme.\n- 70 Additional Items, including a recipe book to help you remember all the recopies.\n\nThe first Edition should be available in couple of days\n\n\nThe Second Edition will provide you with the following content\n\n- 40 New furniture types themed based\n- 16 New Windows\n- 8 New Doors\n- Have stable crop (Cotton) which will be later use to make clothing.\n- Half Blocks for the new custom Blocks\n- 8 New fences\n- 8 New workbenches\n\nFor the moment a lot of the second edition features has already been coded and where in the process of doing bug hunting on and it will probably be released right after the first Edition release\n\nAs for the first release we mainly concentrated on world generated blocks/ores to make sure you don't have to restart our map again, the First Edition runs smoothly and has been finished a while back about 4 to 5 months ago, but we didn't launch yet because we needed a Texture Pack that you can use when playing the Mod, which also provided us with enough time to start development on the second Edition.\n\n\n如果是这个mod的话，基本上就是多加了些石头、木头种类，没啥特别的。\n"
