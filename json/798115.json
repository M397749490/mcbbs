Not in the spaces\nwe know, but between them, they walk serene and primal, undimensioned and to us\nunseen. Yog-Sothoth knows the gate. Yog-Sothoth is the gate. Yog-Sothoth is the\nkey and guardian of the gate. Past, present, future, all are one in Yog-Sothoth.\nHe knows where the Old Ones broke through of old, and where They shall break through\nagain. He knows where They had trod earth's fields, and where They still tread\nthem, and why no one can behold Them as They tread. By Their smell can men sometimes\nknow Them near, but of Their semblance can no man know, saving only in the features\nof those They have begotten on mankind; and of those are there many sorts, differing\nin likeness from man's truest eidolon to that shape without sight or substance\nwhich is Them. They walk unseen and foul in lonely places where the Words have\nbeen spoken and the Rites howled through at their Seasons. The wind gibbers with\nTheir voices, and the earth mutters with Their consciousness. They bend the forest\nand crush the city, yet may not forest or city behold the hand that smites. Kadath\nin the cold waste hath known Them, and what man knows Kadath? The ice desert of\nthe South and the sunken isles of Ocean hold stones whereon Their seal is engraver,\nbut who hath seen the deep frozen city or the sealed tower long garlanded with\nseaweed and barnacles? Great Cthulhu is Their cousin, yet can he spy Them only\ndimly. I?! Shub-Niggurath! As a foulness shall ye know Them. Their hand is at\nyour throats, yet ye see Them not; and Their habitation is even one with your\nguarded threshold. Yog-Sothoth is the key to the gate, whereby the spheres meet.\nMan rules now where They ruled once; They shall soon rule where man rules now.\nAfter summer is winter, after winter summer. They wait patient and potent, for\nhere shall They reign again.\nZombieTeamRocket:\nIntro:\n- Prepare for trouble!\n- Make it double!\n- To protect the world\n- from devastation!\n- To unite all people\n- within our nation!\n- To denounce the evils\n- of truth and love!\n- To extend our reach\n- to the stars above!\n- Jesse!\n- James!\n- Team Rocket blasts off\n- at the speed of light!\n- Surrender now\n- or prepare to fight!\n- Meowth!
