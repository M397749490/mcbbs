But that is exactly what you’re gonna do when you see Meaf’s  Evergreen Villa . Your first thought when you lay eyes on this moody, Gothic structure tucked in the cool embrace of a thick pine forest will assuredly be, ‘yup, vampires live here.’ Fancy, stinking rich, blood sucking vampires.\n你绝不应该以貌取人，对建筑也是一样。但是你在看到Meaf的常青山庄的时候，你绝对会这么做。当你瞥见这隐藏于茂密的松林之中的阴沉哥特式建筑的一角的时候，你心里想的绝对是：“见鬼，这里有吸血鬼。”诚然，想象一下那花哨土豪的吸血血族吧。 \n\nBut there are no vampires here (sigh). Just an MTVictorian Cribs-style mansion that will make you believe something magical might live here.\n但是这里并没有吸血鬼，叹气，只有一个MTVictorian Cribs式的的庄园，它的气息足以让你相信里面居住着魔法。 \n\n\n\n\nAnd it’s not that hard to understand why, as Meaf explains.\n就像是Meaf向我们解释的那样，这很容易理解。 \n\n“I tend to build things that incorporate a lot of influence from older architectural styles, classical, Victorian, and Baroque. But my two absolute favorite styles are Baroque/neoclassical and Gothic. Both incorporate this kind of intricate and extravagant level of detail that looks fantastical when seen in real life.”\n“我很喜欢去建造那些风格仿自古典式、维多利亚式或者巴洛克式风格的建筑，但我最喜欢的两种风格是巴洛克式，或者说新古典主义式，以及哥特式。这两种风格都融合了奢华繁复的细节，在现实之中看起来仿佛如梦一般。” \n\nSo Meaf took real life fantasy, added it to Minecraft’s boundless creativity engine, and the result was something truly magical. He explained to me that a desire to “take advantage of the unlimited creative resources Minecraft offered,” is what pushed him into creative builds.\n”所以Meaf把现实世界的奇幻加入了我的世界那无限可能的创造力引擎之中，得到的成果必然是十分奇妙的。他和我解释道，“利用我的世界的无限创造资源的欲望”促使他搭建了创造性的建筑。\n\n\n“I began with an interest in architecture and realism,” he says. “After building in that realistic genre for a while, perfecting numerous kinds of styles, the limits of realism started to hold my creativity back. So I started building in the fantastic, to treat Minecraft and building as a form of art rather than simple architectural re-creation.”\n“我一开始就对建筑和仿真感兴趣，”他和我说，“在仿造现实建筑建造了一段时间之后，尝试并完善了各式风格之后，仿真这一点呢反而开始限制了我的创造力，所以我开始建造奇幻风格的建筑，将我的世界与建筑本身当成艺术的一种表达形式，而不是单纯的如法炮制。” \n\nEvergreen Villa is art, and art - good art - tells a story.\n长青山庄是艺术，而艺术，我是指好的艺术，会说话。\n\n“Evergreen is a story about showing off,” he continues. “For the owners to show to the world the most magnificent and grand mansion in existence. From the statues, landscaping, and very detailed exterior.”\n“长青山庄讲述了一个关于炫耀的故事，”他接着说到，“这座房子的主人为了向全世界展示世界上现存的最宏伟壮丽的庄园，无论是雕像，还是景观，还有各式细节详尽的装饰。” \n\n\nThe statues are great! No discerning member of the Victorian gentry would be caught dead without a statue on their premises. Like how could you show your face during the Season without at least three?\n这些雕像可太棒了！维多利亚时代的人们不会品鉴雕像可没法见人了，没有经过至少三人好好打量过的雕像，怎么能应季上市呢？ \n\n“I crafted a ton of statues on the villa grounds: a deer, a dragon, an eagle. There’s a human soldier, an angel, and my favorite: the goose.”\n“庄园里有很多我雕刻的雕像：一只鹿、一条龙、一只老鹰，还有个士卒、天使，还有我最喜欢的那个：鹅。” \n\n\nHonk!\n呱！\nGeese are the birds of the bourgeoisie. They go wherever they please and leave poop wherever they go. They’re also extremely territorial. A goose once hissed at me for just looking at it, so they’re the perfect metaphor for those snooty Downton Abbey types. Meaf tries to incorporate a goose into all of his builds, it’s like his calling card - an old joke shared between him and his friends - but hopefully with less territorial hissing.\n鹅是一种代表了资产阶级的鸟类，它们随心所欲，随地排泄，但是领地意识非常强，有只鹅我只是望了他一眼就开始对我嘶叫，所以它们显然很适合比喻那些道顿庄园的居民。Meaf试着在他每一个建筑里都放一只鹅，这就有点像他的招牌——他和他老朋友们中相传的一个老笑话——但是希望不会那么可怕的嘶叫。 \n\nBougie birds aside, my favorite detail of the build was the forest and I had to ask him about it. Turns out it was his favorite too.\n不谈资本主义的鸟类了，建筑上我最喜欢的细节是森林，所以我不得不去问问他他对森林的意见，结果碰巧发现他也很喜欢森林。 \n\n\n“I love the trees,” he explains, “because they add this whole new level of detail to the structure. In the beginning, I was working with a really basic WorldEdit plugin so I had to paste each tree in its individual spot. I’d have to fly, paste, fly again, and paste. Really tedious. I ended up using more than 30 different tree schematics, and 20 alone were just different variants of pine. Despite all that work, though, I would say the forest turned out pretty good.”\n“我很喜欢树，”他和我解释道，“因为他们给整个建筑添加了一种新的层次，一开始，我用的WorldEdit插件非常基础，所以每棵树我都得手动粘贴复制，然后飞到另一个地方，再粘贴复制。这过程真的很无聊，我最后使用了30多种不同的树木schematics文件，其中有二十种只是不同的松树变体。尽管工作量如此巨大，但是我不得不说，这样搞出来的森林还挺不错的。” \n\nPretty good is a bit of an understatement. Evergreen Villa’s flair and detail defy the eye. Meaf’s skill with a block makes this build look like a real life miniature you’d keep under glass at some museum exhibit on Baroque architecture.\n还挺不错这样的一个说法不太够，长青山庄的天赋与细节绝对让你不敢相信，Meaf的方块搭建技巧让这看起来就像是在巴洛克建筑博物馆里展示的建筑微缩模型。 \n\n\nAnd you know what they say: If it’s not Baroque , don’t fix it.\n你知道人们常说：如果风格不是巴洛克式，那就不要修正它。 \n\nThank you, thank you. I’ll see myself out.\n好吧好吧，我自己走吧。 \n\n Renders by Antrelial, Kryiin, Killerack, MateoPaolini, Timothy C., and Skippy. \n渲染自Antrelial, Kryiin, Killerack, MateoPaolini, Timothy C., and Skippy.。 \n\n【我 译自官网 2018 年 02 月 08 日发布的 Evergreen Villa】\n【本文排版借助了：BCC】",
