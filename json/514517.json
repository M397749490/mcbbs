There is a \"worth_sp\" parameter in config.yml that is used to scale\nthem back up to currency prices, this defaults to 10.The spell shop now defaults to working with skill points. To disable this, set \"use_sp: false\" on the spellshop in spells.yml.Wands now use a Skill Point system for progression. This replaces the enchanting system.\nTo switch this back, set \"sp_enabled: false\" in config.yml.Disabled combining wands on an anvil by default (use enable_combining: true in config.yml to change back)Projectile, TNT, ThrowItem, ThrowBlock and Firework all track their projectiles now.\nThis means the actions won't complete until the projectile hits or expires, this may \nimpact existing spells that use these actions coupled with Repeat.Crafting once again gives you the \"default\" wand, not \"beginner\". Default wand changed to\ninclude the Magic Missile spell.Wand crafting recipe changed from \"beginner\" to \"wand\"Updated PreciousStones integration to latest version (unfortunately NOT backwards compatible!)\n5.2.2Undo action \"target_self\" parameter changed to \"target_caster\"Range parameter now defaults to zero. Target type defaults to \"none\" unless range is set.The target_self flag has been generalized, defaults to true if target type is \"self\".May affect Hat-based spells, add \"target_self: true\" if necessary.\n5.2.0The /cast command now bypasses cooldowns. If you don't want this, set \"cast_console_cooldown_reduction: 0\" in config.yml!\n5.1.9Changed icon for architect wand, you may need to tweak existing ones with\n/wand configure icon gold_pickaxe\n5.1Remove the \"elder\" wand from survival configs.You can copy it back in if this is a problem for youIt conflicted with the potter elder wand in combined configurations\n4.9.7Build permissions for spells have been split into build vs break.\nThis mainly affects Towny integration, but if you are using the bypass_build\nconfig option, or the bypass_build permission you may need to include bypass_break\nfor the same effect.\n4.9Haste, health regen and hunger regen were removed in place of potion effects.You may have (Admin, Wolf) wands that made you invulnerable but no longer do.\nYou'll need to get a new one, or do \"/wand configure protected true\"\n4.8.5The worth_items list in config.yml has changed to \"currency\", and the format is different.\nIf you have a customized physical economy, please take note!4.8Spell shops were re-balanced. You can now tweak the \"worth_base\" value in config.yml to scale\nspell prices up or down.Spell shops now default to an emerald-based economy (rather than XP) if Vault is not found.\nThis is configurable via worth_items in config.yml.4.64.6 is a major change under the hood, the biggest since 4.0. I've tried to keep everything\nmostly the same, but there are some changes to be aware of.General updatesMagicWorlds will need to be updated to 1.2Changed configuration options related to construction interval / max blocksThe default restricted material list is much less restrictive. Building with TNT, emeralds, ore, etc is now allowed.Updated and fixed dtlTraders integration.You will need to fix your spell and wand shops- sorryYou may need to disable brush/spell/wand glow until an issue in dtlTraders is resolved\nCustom spell configurationsIf you have a custom spell configuration with \"actions:\" in it, you may need to update:Iterate action renamed to LineReplaceMaterial action renamed to ModifyBlockCoverAction split into Disc and CoverTo reproduce previous behavior, change \"Cover\" to \"Disc\" and add a \"Cover\" under itDisc builds a Disc, Cover searches for the topmost block, up or down, on one block\nAPIJust in case anyone is actually using the API:Changed API cast() methods to return success/failure\n4.5The \"undo\" spell changed its key to \"rollback\" to match the spell's name.\n4.4FlowerSpell flower lists moved to parameters sectionMulti-target base spells no longer supported, must use ConeOfEffectAction (see: laser, push)API Change: Spell.playEffects changed to use a CastContext\n4.0Many default spells migrated to the new \"action\" system.Default configs changed drastically, all auto-undo.Enchanting path options changed from max_xp_max and max_xp_regeneration to max_mana and max_mana_regenerationCommands in command spell parameters have changed slightly.\n(@t -> @tn, @p -> @pn for target and player names)\n3.9.4All of the particle effect names have changed (internal EffectLib change).\nThere is a PHP script available to help migrate custom configs.WorldGuard 6 or higher is now required for region support!\n3.8The \"enable_creative_mode_ejecting\" in config.yml now controls the creative mode special\nbehavior. If you have \"enable_custom_item_hacks\" set to false, you probably want to set\nenable_creative_mode_ejecting to false also.\n3.7Some magic items (spells, upgrades) may need to be updated. Sorry!The \"xp\" casting cost has changed to \"mana\" (\"xp\" is still valid, but consumes player XP)If you have a completely custom spells.yml, search are replace \"xp:\" for \"mana:\" to fix.\n3.6Drop support for Cratbukkit 1.6 - 1.7.2 is now the minimum required versionUpdate to EffectLib 2.0 - all effect class names have changed\n3.5The configuration option \"wand_enchantable_item\" is now off by default. This means\nthat wands won't change to a wooden sword when enchanting. If you are using a pre-1.7.9\nversion of Bukkit, you may (or may not) need to put this option back in config.yml\n3.4The particle effect names have changed to the EffectLib versions is all places:\nhttps://github.com/Slikey/EffectLib/blob/master/src/main/java/de/slikey/effectlib/util/ParticleEffect.java3.3Enchanting is now customizable via multiple enchanting paths. If you had previously modified the \"random\"\ntemplate in wands.yml, you will need to transfer your work to enchanting.yml.\nThere are also now multiple different enchanting paths, review wands.defaults.yml,\nyou will need to override \"path\" for wands if you want them to continue to all use\nthe same enchanting path (now called \"master\").Crafting is now customizable, there are several new recipes apart from the old\nblaze rod + nether star default. Please review crafting.defaults.yml and adjust\naccordingly, especially if you have a customized crafting configuration.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.首先引用作者对该插件的概述\nmagic是一个强力的插件，他可以为您的服务器添加强大的魔杖和物品。拥有超过100个法术，加上各种各样的魔杖模板，也可完全自制功能，你可以用魔法来为你的服务器达到独特的，更有趣味的体验。\n魔法围绕着独特的魔法物品。玩家不“知道”的法术，他们通过发现，购买或制作魔杖来学习魔杖可以绑定到指定的玩家（意思是没有其他的玩家可以使用）也有死亡不掉落专属魔杖\n\n2.可以配合使用的专用材质包\n吐个槽。。这个材质包的图标就像个烈焰棒插了个下界之星一样..这个材质我下载并看了看，包括声音包，怪物的音效和魔法使用音效然后修改了命令方块的材质。。(然并卵..)还有各种魔法的特效。可以说使用了才有了真正的魔法的感觉，推荐使用。作者的话：You are free to mix this into your own RP, or use it directly. (I may remove this link if hosting costs become too high though!)译：你可以直接使用本材质，也可以将它添加进入你的材质包里使用。(这个链接托管费用很高，我或许会删除它的下载链接。)材质包尽量保持不改变任何重要的东西，但改变了这些：\n\n\n\n木锄头：作为默认的魔杖金斧头：建筑师魔杖金锄头：管理员魔杖金铲子：扫帚(哈利波特即视感)僵尸马的材质和声音(骑扫帚的巫婆)命令方块的材质Ender portal frame inventory texture (not the in-game block), for Magic hat.似乎是一个NEI获得一类的方块锁甲：修改为法师袍子\n材质包下载地址：http://pan.baidu.com/s/1c0ugN52\n\n3.插件地址1.6.4版：http://pan.baidu.com/s/1eQyM2Ue1.7.X版：http://pan.baidu.com/s/1sjy0a4H1.8.X版：http://pan.baidu.com/s/1hqhh4Ja\n插件讲解转帖：http://www.mcbbs.net/thread-514706-1-1.html不断更新，教程贴需要审核，点不进去是在审核这么优秀的插件我这么精心的讲解是不是该给点鼓励啊。嘿嘿\n\n\n\n\n[groupid=1151]Minecraft插件百科[/groupid]",
