If you place it in the .minecraft folder (NOT into the minecraft.jar), it will be read and change some standard settings. The file is not required to run IndustrialCraft, it will run fine without them.\n\n在Minecraft的FAQ\nQ: Why does my game black screen?\n-A: There are a number of reasons this could happen, the most likely is that you're trying to play alpha through the browser. Mods don't work with the browser version. I do not care about black screens. Get me the error log. Follow the instructions under the \"Linux / Other\" download on www.minecraft.net. This applies to all OS.\n\n看了沒有正確的解決方法\n\n現求解決方法或一個巳裝ModLoader及機械MOD的Minecrat1.401檔\n\n萬二分感謝\n\n\n\n原文[1.4_01] IndustrialCraft [v6.00]\n\n\n",
