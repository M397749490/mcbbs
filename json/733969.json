This will cause all of the player's hired units to target the mobs in the area, that the sword points at unless the hired units are allied with it.\n\nThe player doesn't have to be within interacting range of the target, and they can use the sword even if there are hired units or allies between them and the target. However, the target must be within the hired units' attack range, or else they will not be able to pathfind to it and will simply do nothing.\n\nTo cancel the attack, the player must right-click on nothing in particular (no mobs) with the sword in hand.\n\nThe sword has unlimited uses (durability), but it cannot be used to block and provides no attack bonus without being enchanted."
