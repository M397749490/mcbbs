It accomplishes this by increasing the difficulty of survival mode and introducing new content and game mechanics. MITE is a comprehensive mod that alters roughly 500 of the game's class files and adds many new ones. Some highlights of the MITE mod are listed below:\n\nReduced Player Starting Health And Nutrition\nBegin with 3 heart and food icons instead of 10, and gain one of each for every 5 levels of experience\nReduced Player Harvesting Capabilities\nLogs may be harvested only while wielding a hatchet, axe or battle axe\nStone and ore blocks cannot be harvested unless you have a mining tool such as a pickaxe or war hammer\nIf you begin to starve you will be too weak from hunger to break or place blocks, and your movement speed will be reduced\nSubsistence Living\nEmbark as a hunter/gatherer in the Stone Age, only able to hunt animals and gather plants for sustenance until you discover flint tools\nStruggle to find enough food each day to make it through the night and see another sunrise\nAdopt a nomadic lifestyle as you deplete local resources and are forced to move on\nFind a better way to live once you have stockpiled enough food to make a stand against hunger\nImproved Mob AI\nMobs detect players from further away and their missile attacks have increased range and accuracy\nMobs will not despawn if you can see them or they can see you\nAnimals require food and water, and are able to seek it out on their own\nAnimals are also more effective at evading predators (you will see a lot of this)\nFour New Ores And Metals\nCopper, silver, mithril and adamantium have been added to the mix; each metal has its own characteristics\nSearch deep within the bowels of the earth to discover the largest and most precious ore veins\nNew Furnaces And Heat Levels\nIntroducing the clay oven, sandstone oven, obsidian furnace and netherrack furnace, each with its own capacity for withstanding heat\nWood and charcoal can be burned in any oven and produce enough heat to cook meat\nThe lesser metals (copper, silver, gold and iron) can be smelted in a stone furnace burning coal\nA lava-fueled obsidian furnace has enough heat to smelt mithril\nNetherrack furnaces are the only furnaces capable of withstanding the intense heat of blaze rods; these are used to smelt adamantium\nTen New Mobs\nIntroducing the dire wolf, wood spider, ghoul, wight, shadow, invisible stalker, hellhound, demon spider, infernal creeper, and fire elemental\nMost of the new mobs are encountered only at deeper levels; the game grows more perilous the deeper you delve\nA Dozen New Achievements\nThey will provide you with a roadmap of how to survive in this new, harsh world\nNew Tools and Durability System\nMITE adds to your arsenal the cudgel, club, hatchet, knife, dagger, war hammer, battle axe, mattocks and scythe\nTool durability is reduced according to the hardness of the harvested block\nThe flint hatchet is the simplest tool that will allow you to harvest wood from trees\nThe copper pickaxe is the most easily crafted tool that will allow you to harvest stone and ore blocks\nAdded Enchantments\nSpeed (boots)\nStun (war hammers)\nFortune (fishing rods)\nRegeneration (torso armor)\nFertility (hoes and mattocks)\nTree Felling (axes and battle axes)\nVampiric (swords, daggers and scythes)\nEnhanced Farming\nCultivate the new onion crop and use it to prepare delicious food dishes\nBeware the blight, a dread disease that can afflict your crops and ruin their yield\nManure, a valuable resource periodically dropped by livestock, can be used to fertilize farmland\nA new time-forwarding mechanism allows crops to grow even when no players are nearby\nWeather Effects\nPlayer's hunger rate is increased while standing in the rain; it pays to find shelter\nFishing is more productive during rain storms\nSecurity Of Valuables In Multiplayer Games\nStrongboxes are chests that are crafted from metal; they can only be opened by the player who places them\nCrafting Recipes\n\n\nMITE adds many new recipes to the game and alters some of of the existing one\n版主必看：\n\n此整合版是原创不是转载，\n\n\n\n\n安装证明：\n\n\n\n\n具体证明：    难道版主你想说把1。6.4-MITE放进去就可以玩？！仔细看看图！\n作者是提供的mod不是整合包！！！！\n\nmod：\n\nME is too easy mod原地址\n启动器：\n\nhuanghongxun提供了HML启动器\n\n\n关于下载的选择：\n可选大的或者小的\n大的就是完全的整合版很多你需要下载的已经帮你下了。\n小的就是删去了一部分文件可能需要下载\n\n大的可以避免：\n\n[/spoiler]\n下载地址：\n[spoiler]https://pan.baidu.com/s/1qXN2Ubq\nmod下载地址：我们尊正作者：http://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding/minecraft-mods/1294284-minecraft-is-too-easy-mite-mod?page=269\n\n关于合成表：\n 看不清？点我\n\n\n游戏图片：\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n最后提醒版主：\n如果你我有版权问题的争议请私信我，或者帮我改改，或者[qq]2354894095[/qq]\n\n\n看不清的点击图片即可求金粒砸破头\n-----------------------------End---------------------------\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
