Do not just cover it.\nIf \"not enough space\" is still showing, then do the following:\n\n    exit Minecraft.\n    edit \"config.txt\" in the millenaire folder and change village_radius to 85.\n    edit \"grosbourg.txt\" in the millenaire\\buildingplans\\villages folder and change the radius to 85.\n    edit the hamlet village files in the millenaire\\buildingplans\\villages folder and change the radius to 65.\n    edit the text files in the millenaire\\buildingplans\\extra folder and change the maxDistance to 85.\n    restart Minecraft. \n\nAnd if it's still refuses to work, then clear a 50x50 flat space around the townhall."
