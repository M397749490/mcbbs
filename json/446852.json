            "txt_content": "原文：\n\nHello! \n\nIf you're interested in testing out this upcoming update head on over to the Preview branch! You can gain access by right clicking on Unturned in your Steam library, selecting properties, navigating to the Betas tab and entering the secret passcode \"OPERATIONMAPLELEAF\". \n\nPriorities:\n\nYou may have noticed several updates that were switched on and then back off the last week or so, as the current major goal is to improve networking performance. I still have several things to test, but hopefully it will get much better in the future. \n\nTo help with this I've also added Linux support which should lower hosting costs and open up access to higher quality servers. There are still some issues to work out though, so the client is not yet in tip-top shape. When testing it on your server run it with ulimit -n 2048 as it currently opens too many files as part of mod support. \n\nOther than that I want to try and fix up the game as much as possible before moving onto new content and features such as hunting/fishing/the next map. \n\nSteam Inventory:\n\nValve's new inventory service is now out of beta and implemented in Unturned. This will allow you to customize your character with silly cosmetics that it wouldn't make much sense to find in-game such as 3D glasses. \n\nIt also means you will be able to make money on the community market selling cosmetic item drops you get, and opens up the option to add Steam trading cards to Unturned which I see commonly requested. Going forward this can also be expanded to include community contributions from the curated Workshop. \n\nFor the mean time, however, I believe it is best to leave this disabled until the above priorities are complete. What do you think about the sound of it though? \n\n\n\nTrello:\n\nThe to-do list page found here is now a lot more organized! If you want to see what is currently being worked on you can check back there. \n\n3.10.3.0 Patch:\n\nAdditions: \nAdded ability to escape out of alerts on the menu.\nAdded colored chat support and R/G/B parameters to say/welcome commands. This is open to rocket mod developers as well.\n\nImprovements: \nImproved barricade/structure networking with many items in crates.\nImproved dedicated server to show exceptions.\nImproved dedicated server performance.\nImproved tooltip to match the color if its button.\nImproved tooltip to swap sides based on space on screen.\nImproved inventory backgrounds to show item quality.\nImproved cosmetic inventory scaling.\nImproved vehicle speed smoothing on client.\nImproved resource ID linking.\n\nTweaks: \nTweaked \"Effect Quality\" to \"Debris Quality\" to make more sense.\n\nFixes: \nFixed changing resolution in-game.\nFixed bug when zombies respawned.\nFixed item positioning over network.\nFixed an exploit using rich text in chat.\nFixed changing scope resoltion in-game.\nFixed zombies loading on main menu.\nFixed invalid casts with attachments.\nFixed invalid casts with clothing.\nFixed elbow bending weight.\nFixed preview achievement.\nFixed dedicated server default quality.\nFixed cosmetic cloth swapping collider.\nFixed glasses not register for hair/beard.\nFixed loading structures extra packet.\nFixed message like reload getting colored.\nFixed vehicles not to damage structures.\nFixed slot items stuck after crafting them.\nFixed attachments save getting corrupted.\nFixed closing clothing UI icons file.\nFixed order of character saving.\nFixed some classes in the wrong namespace.\nFixed resource IDs needing to be continuous.\nFixed no servers box on server list.\nFixed confirmation buttons to reset after closing.\nFixed dedicated server failing to load visual clothes.\n\nOn a personal note this Wednesday is graduation! :D \n\nThanks for reading!"
