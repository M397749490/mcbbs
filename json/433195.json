V5.2:New island type: None (doesn't spawn an island for that slot)\n An unlinked dungeon can now spawn on an island that allows a linked one, but that doesn't have a linked one\n Split config option for dungeon chance into 2 separate chances for both types, old config value is respected during conversion and becomes the new dungeonchance.linked one\nV5.1:Updated to MC 1.7.9\nV5.0:Added custom dungeon loot chest tables (will explain fully on this page)\n Fixed tiny bug where single-blocks of snow coverage were missing on taiga islands\n Redwood trees on taiga islands now remove snow their leaves would cover (not perfect yet)\nV4.1:Fixed missing jungle trees\n Added config setting for island height scaling\n Added config setting for island underbelly scaling (with respect to the top half)\n Changed config setting for island start height to be 2 numbers for min and max (previous setting auto converts)\n Added config setting to change the size range of islands (may get buggy and/or look weird with very large values)\n Added config setting for max number of rooms in a dungeon\n Added config setting for min and max number of chests per dungeon room\n Added config setting for the chance of extra dungeon 'doors' between rooms that were created earlier in the generation, these are not needed for a fully connected dungeon and are good for making the dungeon harder to navigate\nV4.0:Added metrics for mcstats.org\n Toggle-able option to control placing grass on taiga islands (default: off)\n Toggle-able nether portal generation (default: on)\n Toggle-able end portal generation (default: on)\n Toggle-able zombie pigman spawners (default: on)\n Toggle-able obsidian pillars (default: on)\n Naturally spawning villages using schematics that you provide\nV3.2:Improved island underbellies\n Improved lake islands\n Lake islands are now a lot bigger and deeper\n Added lapis ore\nV3.1:Ores no longer generate in sand (custom ores still can)\n Desert islands are now mostly sandstone instead of mostly sand\n Fixed nether ores being placed mid-air at lake islands\nV3.0:Added custom ore creation (will explain fully on this page)\n Added nether quartz and glowstone to the list of removable blocks\n Added glowstone ore veins to nether islands\n Only nether quartz and glowstone veins will be on nether islands\n Added config setting for glowstone vein rarity\n No ores spawn on ender islands (unless custom ones added for it)\n Nether quartz and glowstone veins can generate into the air\nV2.2:Cacti no longer spawns next to other blocks or other cacti\n Cacti now varies in height\n Server OPs are told about a new version when they join the server\n Server OPs do not get told about a new version in an update check, unless it's different to the last one (console still gets told)\n Trees spawn inside other trees a lot less now (still slightly common with redwood)\n Increased tree coverage on islands that have trees, to balance tree checks\n Valid spawn islands now check the island has at least 1 tree, instead of just being a certain type\nV2.1:Fixed biome setter to set the biome if no parent worldgen is set\n Pigman spawners on nether islands now spawn when a player is within 64 blocks\n Spawners in dungeons now spawn when a player is within 26 blocks\n There should no longer be warnings in the console about spawners when an island generates over another island\n Tiny performance increase involving spawners\n Gravel no longer replaces bottom blocks on islands, to prevent lag if this happens on desert islands and the gravel falls\nV2.0:You can now set a 'parent' world generator, which the islands will add on to (will default to none if it can't be found)\n Grass/Flowers/Mushrooms are now removed if the block they were on is also removed (not 100% tested)\nV1.8.1.1:Added tall grass and flowers to the list of erasable blocks (things like dungeons hated them)\n Rounded island spawn chances to 2 decimals\n Update checker will no longer do an on load update check if the delay is set to 0 or less (got told off for having it forced :P)\nV1.8.1:Added tall grass and flowers\n Added config for how much tall grass spawns, per grass block (default 0.4)\n Added config for how much tall grass to replace with flowers (default 0.15)\nV1.8:Added lake islands, comes with sand edges and is mostly water, there is normally clay and sugar cane on the island\n Changed dungeon loot, replaced dirt with pumpkin/melon seeds and sugar cane\n Added config values to change the chance of lake islands, and the chance of clay and sugar cane on these islands\n Dungeons will no longer spawn on ender islands, never seen them on one because they're rare, but I imagine it would look odd\nV1.7.1:Removed a 5-second delay on plugin start-up if routine checks were disabled with the timer set to 0\nV1.7:Added config options to change the chances of each island type\n The spawn will be set to be on an island with trees if the current spawn is invalid\n Added a command (/islegen) to check on the plugin and the various config settings, available to all users, and with some sub-commands\n The plugin now checks for updates when reloading and every 15 minutes after that (by default), notifying admins if any are found, and shortening the link with bit.ly so you can click it in the MC chat without losing half the link\nV1.6:Added ender island, with obsidian towers and end portals\n Added config option to change how many caves are generated (default 1.0)\n Fixed a crash when islands generate below y=0 or above world height\n Changes to island generation code to make them more interesting\n Added quartz ore to nether islands\n Dungeons now remove sandstone when being placed\nV1.5:Changes to loot in dungeon chests\n Added config value to set the per-island chance for dungeons on islands that allow them (default 0.02)\n Dungeon rooms are now always connected to each other to make them more spacious and annoying\nV1.4:Added water patches to the surface of swamps\n Reduced spacing between islands\n Island spacing can now be set in the config (V1.0-V1.2 used 6, V1.3 used 10, default is 8)\n Island starting height can now be set in the config (default is 150)\n Island ore rarity, water/lava pool rarity and gravel patch rarity can now be set in the config (1.0 is normal, 2.0 is double, 0.5 is half, etc.)\nV1.3:Added dungeon complexes\n Beaches no longer generate on some biomes, as they looked weird\n Increased spacing between islands, as they would often overlap (avoid using V1.3 with worlds made using older version)\nV1.2:Caves are now generated in islands, larger islands will contain more caves.\n Gravel 'blobs' and water/lava pools no longer get half cut-off by the generation code going over it.\nV1.1:Mushroom 'trees' are now made with my own code, so they don't get cut-off.\n Ores are now placed into islands in veins of varying sizes, which was intended in the first place.\nV1.0:Initial Release \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQQ截图20150412133853.jpg (61.49 KB, 下载次数: 47)\n\n下载附件\n\n2015-4-12 13:37 上传\n\n\n\n\n其中的一个小岛\n\n\n\n\n\n\n插件使用方法：使用MultiVerse世界插件指令就是：/mv create <世界名> normal -g
