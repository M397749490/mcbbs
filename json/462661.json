Why was it re-uploaded? Because of drastic changes to both interior and exterior (if we would have to update the original, we would have to delete all original content and re-upload new screenshots, which is a lot easier by just re-uploading the project). \nBig thanks to: \n- Elperath, for the cinematic \n- The BeastsMC Community, for great support! \n\nYou can also check out this build on the BeastsMC server! \n\nA showcase by SilboMovies! \n\n[paper]团队建筑许可证明：\n\n\n\n\nQQ图片20150703110156.jpg (15.42 KB, 下载次数: 14)\n\n下载附件\n\n2015-7-3 11:08 上传\n\n\n\n\n\n\n——建筑信息——\n\nProgress:100% Complete Tags:Palace, Paladin, Desert, Minecraft, Cinematic, Fantasy, Oasis, Ruben00, Elrinir, 3D ArtCredit:All members of the BeastsMc server who helped with w/e, and Fox_Squirrel&Komoris for great support!\n\n\n\nFAQ：少废话了！发图\n好马上！\n\n \n更多图片请看原文~~\n——下载地址——\n\n在上面\n\n\n",
